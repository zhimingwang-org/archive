  <div class="entry-content"><p>I propose the following cloud storage and syncing service model of the future. I call it <strong>Dropbot for Geeks®</strong>, and it totally rules. It&rsquo;s designed for geeks who are tired of the highly limited, miserably unproductive traditional services (based on clicking around). It has the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Standard Unix file system commands exposed as an API, e.g., <code>cat</code>, <code>cd</code>, <code>cp</code>, <code>du</code>, <code>df</code>, <code>file</code>, <code>find</code>, <code>head</code>, <code>ln</code>, <code>ls</code>, <code>mkdir</code>, <code>mv</code>, <code>pwd</code>, <code>rm</code>, <code>rmdir</code>, <code>tail</code>, <code>touch</code>, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>A rudimentary shell emulator through the web interface exposing the commands above.</p></li>
<li><p>Secure shell access to the file system, also exposing the commands above. Provide two-factor auth for SSH. Clearly, <code>scp</code> should also be supported.</p></li>
<li><p>Checksums. Expose, for instance, <code>md5sum</code> or <code>sha1sum</code>, in the API. Provide checksums on download pages, probably on demand.</p></li>
<li><p>Programmable selective syncing, down to per file level.</p></li>
<li><p>Scriptability. Allow clients to run custom scheduled jobs or daemons with the API above. To prevent the service from becoming full-featured IaaS, though, clients might be limited in CPU time, memory, or command selection. This bullet point is arguable.</p></li>
</ul>


<hr />

<p>With the level of command line integration illustrated above, we&rsquo;ll finally get rid of clicking around and not being able to automate chores. Navgating the remote file system will be a breeze — click, click, click, click, click (sometimes click should be replaced by double click, which is even more painful) just to navigate to a directory will be made a thing of the past. <code>ln</code>, in particular, saves disk space for duplicates — Dropbot for Geeks does <em>not</em> want to charge you extra for multiple copies of the same file in different directories. (To facilitate syncing hardlinks, clients should be able to specify hardlinked files in a config file. Or maybe some better mechanism. This might be hard.) At last, checksums are a must. I’ve had traumatic experiences like having downloaded an eight-part RAR, 1 GiB each, only to find that it wouldn’t unRAR. Without checksums, it was impossible to find which part was corrupted. As a result, I had to re-download everything — a nightmare. I never want to experience similar problems again. Hence the precious checksums.</p>

<p>Dropbot for Geeks looks like a pretty good (well, not really, but at least pretty cool®) model. Maybe I should patent it before anyone else? Then if some similar service surfaces in the future, I can <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/11/jury-apple-must-pay-23-6m-for-old-pager-patents/">sue their ass off and enjoy some hot cash</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong><em>TL; DR:</em> The actual PDF write-up is <a href="/pdf/20141119-convolution-of-irreducible-characters.pdf">here</a>.</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>Yesterday I was trying to establish the formula for orthogonal primitive central idempotents of a group ring. It is possible to establish the result through the convolution of irreducible characters. However, I stuck quite a while on trying to work out the convolutions themselves. For a formidable and unenlightening proof using &ldquo;matrix entry functions&rdquo; (i.e., fix a basis, induce a matrix representation, and explicitly expand everything in matrix elements), see <a href="http://drexel28.wordpress.com/2011/03/02/representation-theory-using-orthogonality-relations-to-compute-convolutions-of-characters-and-matrix-entry-functions/">this post</a> (in fact, this is just one in a series of posts that lead up to the result). That&rsquo;s a really sad proof.</p>

<p>It turns out that I really should have been working the other way round &mdash; first establish the orthogonal idempotents (the proof of which is really simple and elegant, I was just trapped in a single thread of thought), then use that to compute the convolution of irreducible characters.</p>

<p>I feel like this is worth presenting (as the only proof I saw online is the really sad one above), so I TeX&#8217;ed it up. I tried to convert to MathJax HTML but eventually gave up (that&rsquo;s the story for another post). So, the write-up is in good ol&#8217; PDF, available <a href="/pdf/20141119-convolution-of-irreducible-characters.pdf">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>AT&amp;T finally delivered my iPhone 6 Plus (silver, 64 GB) after about fifty days since preorder… The 1080p Retina display is simply stunning. However, it turns out that my old videos don’t work so well on 6 Plus’s giant screen. My old mobile video collection was optimized for my 16 GB 4S, targeting the small screen and highly limited storage — you guessed it, they were resized to 960x540, and they looked great. But they’re not up to the task any more. 960x540 videos aren’t at all sharp on the stunning screen of 6 Plus, which is more than capable of handling 4x pixels. Therefore, I have no choice but to feed it more pixels. I’m left in a weird situation, where my 1080p desktop (or even HDTV) quality videos should fit the screen just fine, but H.264 profile stands in the way. iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are only capable of High Profile level 4.2, so anything encoded in level 5.1, for instance, needs to be re-encoded. Also there are still MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 videos out there (MPEG-4 should be obsolete by now, I assume, but some people still use it; and MPEG-2 is de facto in TV broadcasts), which have to be transcoded. Okay, it’s a daunting task to re-encode a fairly big collection, but I have to do it sooner or later. Presumably this weekend. I’ll also report whether 720p videos look sharp on the screen later.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today (I mean November 7, 2014 — it’s technically November 8 at the time of writing) I saw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_%28film%29"><em>Interstellar</em></a> (IMAX digital) at AMC Mercado 20. I rarely go to movie theaters, less on the release day (film formats of <em>Interstellar</em> were released on November 5, and digital formats followed on November 7). However, reviews of it were positive (from the physics community), and I really need a way to release stress these days — I wasn’t in the right condition for months. So I figured I’d just spend an afternoon in front of the big screen.</p>

<p>I’ve heard good things about IMAX 70mm film, like no trailers, among other things. But I didn’t bother the extra seven miles’ drive to Hackworth IMAX Dome, so I landed on IMAX digital. Still a pretty stunning experience, although I ended up watching forty minutes worth of trailers before the real thing (arrived fifteen minutes early). In hindsight maybe I’d be better off spending some extra time on the road.</p>

<p>Speaking of the movie itself, they tried to make it as plausible as possible from a physics viewpoint, by involving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kip_Thorne">Kip Thorne</a> of Caltech. (There’s even a book out, <em>The Science of Interstellar</em>.) For instance, the wormhole isn’t portrayed as a hole (I mean, imagine a ring in empty space, as you would picture in your mind when you hear the word “hole” out of nothing; that’s not how it looks like here, and there’s a nice explanation). Some of the physics still doesn’t work out quite well, though, like Cooper’s not crushed at the singularity… Also there are communications from within the horizon and breakdown of causality, explained in the movie as happening in four dimension slices of some five dimensional spacetime where time could be a physical dimension. Obviously these are needed to get the sci-fi story going, so no one should be blamed.</p>

<p>I was there for the sci-fi and physics, but a nice surprise was that I was also touched by the humanity elements of story, I mean, family and stuff.</p>

<p>The downside: Cooper’s accent was a bit hard on me ☹</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For some reason, I only learned about this year’s laureates today, through <a href="http://motls.blogspot.com/2014/11/ex-employer-wont-meet-blue-led-nobel.html">the reference frame</a>. The prize goes to the inventors of the LED. Not exciting at all, so I don’t care if I’m ever informed. (Lubos has a good point on why applied physics — well, let’s even widen the concept of applied physics a bit — should not surprise anyone when they appear in a Nobel Prize announcement: “After all, Alfred Nobel might have very well considered his dynamite to be a discovery in physics, too.”)</p>

<p>The Nobel Prize Physics Awards has been rather amusing in recent years. Partly due to controversy on the theoretical front and no breakthrough on the experimental front, I guess. (The discovery of Higgs was a breakthrough to some extent, but it was totally expected; little physics beyond SM at LHC before LS1 is sad. Since it was totally expected, the award went to theorists — some experimentalists might not be too thrilled.) Just look at the recent list: 2010, graphene (shouldn’t that be chemistry? if material science can be part of physics, then chemistry must surely encompass it, too); 2009, CCD sensor (whatever that means, maybe that’s important); 2008, fibers (okay, I love fast Internet connections). The list actually goes all the way down to early 20th century, but it’s much denser in recent decades. Now one more: 2014, LED.</p>

<blockquote><p>“for the invention of efficient blue light-emitting diodes which has enabled bright and energy-saving white light sources”</p></blockquote>

<p>Wow, energy-saving. I guess next year’s prize will go to the inventors of high efficiency urinals, for being resource-saving.
<strong>I mean, LEDs are great, but not great as physics, much less a physics breakthrough.</strong></p>

<p>Let’s compare the applied folks to other laureates: Lorentz, J. J. Thomson, Planck, Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, Schrödinger, Dirac, Fermi, Pauli, Born, Lee, Yang, Landau, Feynman, Schwinger, Gell-Mann, Weinberg, ’t Hooft, etc. Not on the same level.</p>

<p>It’s good to see that a growing body of physicists are (or at least as it seems to me) increasingly reserved about the Nobel Prize, and prizes in general. Same goes for math, with the Nobel Prize replaced by something else. (Employers still love the big titles, I suppose — good to have some star faculty on board.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apple is pushing Yosemite hard and secretly Yosemitizing things. iTunes was updated to its shiny new look on Mavericks, day one upon Yosemite launch. I liked it. The only problems I had with the new iTunes are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It&rsquo;s no longer possible to go to the Artists view and Music Videos view with one click. Artists is now a drop-down menu option in My Music view; Music Videos is now a sidebar tab in Playlists view.</p></li>
<li><p>The red icon doesn&rsquo;t look as good as the previous blue one, and it doesn&rsquo;t harmonize too well alongside the blue Finder and Mail. Maybe they will look better together in Yosemite.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Just now I found that the Mac App Store in Mavericks is also Yosemitized:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/T7KIo6s.png" alt="Yosemitized Mac App Store" /></p>

<p>The chromeless UI certainly looks a bit weird, and the font seems a bit too small. However, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll quickly get over these shortcomings, and might even grow to appreciate them. Even more so when I finally upgrade to Yosemite (I&rsquo;ll wait for Thanksgiving break or 10.10.1 this year, whichever comes first — looks like the former will come first, considering the first 10.10.1 developer beta was out <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2014/11/03/first-yosemite-10-10-1-beta-now-available/">merely two days ago</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/IVFV7E2.png">reportedly</a> focusing on WiFi, etc.).</p>

<p>On the font side, unfortunately the small font size in the new Mac App Store does make text fuzzy on my non-Retina display. I didn&rsquo;t notice the fuzziness in the new iTunes. Anyway, everything is optimized for Retina — Apple is also secretly pushing Retina hard. In the Apple ecosystem, apparently you always want to stay at the top of the line. Due to Apple&rsquo;s nature, the degree of hardware-software integration is simply unparalleled, so only the latest hardware enjoys all the new features and love. Unfortunately, the typical lifespan of a Mac is much longer than the hardware/software release cycle.</p>

<p>The truth is, we (or at least I) adapt to things much quicker and easier than we&rsquo;d imagined (or otherwise would be willing to admit). When iOS 7 was demo&#8217;ed on WWDC 2013, I was like &ldquo;no way! What&rsquo;s with those stupid flat crap?&rdquo; But when the update came, I hopped on and was happy ever since. (I reserve my opinion on the icon design.) Later when I installed an app that was not updated for the new UI, I was like &ldquo;OMG, what&rsquo;s with this clumsy UI?&rdquo; I guess legibility issues, WiFi issues (with Yosemite) and responsiveness issue (with iOS 8 on iPhone 4S — <em>AT&amp;T, where&rsquo;s my preordered 6 Plus?</em>) are harder to impossible to adapt to, but they will eventually be fixed, or support-dropped, or hardware-upgraded (with $$). So in the end (almost) everyone will be happy. And one day when we face the old thing again by chance, we&rsquo;ll flee as fast as we can: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s with that&hellip;&rdquo; (I did exaggerate. Also, I know, many people just don&rsquo;t care about design, or have ill tastes, or can&rsquo;t find the buttons after a minimal number of UI tweaks — I&rsquo;m not including them in the &ldquo;we&rdquo; here.) Those who claim that &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t upgrade until&hellip;&rdquo; are just kidding themselves, and certainly no one will wait for them or make their &ldquo;until&hellip;&rdquo; come true. Most of those &ldquo;won&rsquo;t upgrade&rdquo; folks will eventually upgrade and be happy. For those that really don&rsquo;t upgrade (like those still running Snow Leopard) either can&rsquo;t afford the new hardware, or suffer from senility (seen from the deep hostility towards new things). Or they have some important legacy software that would break with an upgrade; poor dudes.</p>

<p>Same goes for newer, shinier, seemingly unnecessary deluxe hardware. I&rsquo;m still stuck on a Mid-2012 MBP 13&#8221; Non-Retina. Retina seems highly useless for me since I do most of my work on the 27&#8221; external display — the 13&#8221; internal LCD hosts a single maximized Activity Monitor window most of the time (and sometimes also a Transmission window). I expect my opinion about Retina to change after I upgrade to a Retina model next year. (It will be a pretty major purchase though — i7, 16 GB memory, and 512 GB SSD are musts, and there are like a million peripherals to buy — Thunderbolt to Ethernet, Super Drive, etc., etc.) This shift of opinion after upgrading to something unnecessarily good (and ending up not being able to tolerate anything inferior) is best described as &ldquo;<strong>sadly converted</strong>&rdquo;. Some folks are already sadly converted by the Retina iMac. See, for example, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/11/yes-the-5k-retina-imacs-screen-runs-at-60hz-at-5k-resolution/#p11">this article</a> on Ars Technica:</p>

<blockquote><p>Prior to getting the Retina iMac on my desk, I would have said that &ldquo;retina&rdquo; isn’t necessarily something we need on the desktop. Most people don’t notice pixels on the desktop at a normal seating distance. However, after getting to A/B compare the Retina iMac with the standard one over the course of a week, I’m sadly converted. I just don’t know if my wallet can take the abuse.</p></blockquote>

<p>And others are bitterly desiring one (me included — sadly two Mac are too much for a university dorm). See, for example, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/11/yes-the-5k-retina-imacs-screen-runs-at-60hz-at-5k-resolution/?comments=1&amp;post=27896871">this comment</a> on the aforementioned article:</p>

<blockquote><p>I WISH APPLE TECHNICA WOULD STOP WITH ALL THESE ARTICLES ABOUT THE IMAC.</p>

<p>It really makes me want one unjustifiably.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Of course you are always welcome to use the <a href="https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/">Google APIs Client Library for Python</a> to wrestle with YouTube, which is usually pretty simple. (As an added bonus, YouTube has some <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/code_samples/">nice runnable sample scripts</a> to get you started.) With the client library, listing videos in a YouTube playlist is a breeze.</p>

<p>However, if you don&rsquo;t feel like writing code yourself (I usually don&rsquo;t feel like writing code myself until I use something often enough and existing solutions are suboptimal), <code>youtube-dl</code> recently added the functionality to list videos in a playlist with the <code>--flat-playlist</code> option.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/issues/4003#issuecomment-60322630">According to one of the project collaborators</a>, currently <code>--flat-playlist</code> is only helpful with the <code>-j</code> option for dumping JSON (so I suppose this feature is subject to change). For instance, <code>--flat-playlist</code> alone would emit something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>which doesn&rsquo;t really make sense — it tells you that it collected 119 video ids, and no more. Once you have <code>-j</code> on, you get JSON data that you can parse with anything:</p>

<p>The most straightforward way to parse this is to use a command line JSON parser, the best one being <a href="https://github.com/stedolan/jq">jq</a>:</p>

<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> I first embedded the gist here, but <a href="http://i.imgur.com/m3cr0Im.png">it looked a bit off</a>. See <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/issues/1392">imathis/octopress#1392</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>In the next version of the Gist tag plugin we are just downloading the gists and embedding them upon generation so we don&rsquo;t have to worry about GitHub going down and breaking all your gists, or changing the HTML and breaking all the styles.</p>

<p>For the time being I suggest embedding your code snippets directly if you want them to look good.</p></blockquote>

<p>Okay. End of aside.</p>

<p>By the way, <code>youtube-dl</code> supports playlist bulk download natively. The reason I need a list of video ids or URIs, however, is that among other things, <code>youtube-dl</code> doesn&rsquo;t download highest resolution DASH video by default, so I have to rely on something like <code>youtube-dl-dash</code> (<a href="https://github.com/zmwangx/sh/blob/master/youtube-dl-dash">link</a>) to download the best version.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few days ago, I was cloning my entire Audio CD and DVD collection, and reported some of the findings in <a href="/blog/2014/10/26/audio-cd-slash-dvd-to-iso-image-on-os-x/">this post</a>. As said, the most important commands are</p>

<pre><code>hdiutil makehybrid -iso -joliet -o AUDIO_CD_NAME.iso SOURCE
</code></pre>

<p>for Audio CDs and</p>

<pre><code>hdiutil makehybrid -udf -o DVD_NAME.iso SOURCE
</code></pre>

<p>for DVDs.</p>

<p>Those alone don&rsquo;t finish the story. I also tried other things and unfortunately encountered problems. I was too busy to report back then, but now I&rsquo;ll summarize some of the findings.</p>

<hr />

<p>For one thing, <code>hdiutil makehybrid</code> might fail, issuing an &ldquo;Operation not permitted&rdquo; for no obvious reason. This could even happen when you work with the Disk Utility GUI (for which I once got a &ldquo;Permission denied&rdquo;). Even <code>sudo</code> didn&rsquo;t help in my case. However, I was able to <strong>circumvent the problem with the root shell</strong> (I won&rsquo;t tell you how to enter the root shell — you need to at least have that amount of knowledge about the root shell before you are given the key). Not sure why. Just keep in mind that the root shell might help (that&rsquo;s also a general, albeit dangerous, advice for life).</p>

<hr />

<p>Next onto grabbing the raw VOB.</p>

<p><code>vobcopy</code> is pretty sweet, but at least for me it had one huge problem. When I tried to copy a single title, say title #2 with</p>

<pre><code>vobcopy --title-number TITLE_NUMBER -i SOURCE
</code></pre>

<p>other titles got copied, too. I didn&rsquo;t have enough samples to test out, but presumably it&rsquo;s because the problematic DVD has a structure like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HTgmwQL.png" alt="problematic DVD title structure" /></p>

<p>Anyway, no matter I <code>vobcopy</code> title 01, 02, or 03, the result was the same — the whole thing. That&rsquo;s pretty stupid. I don&rsquo;t know if it counts as a bug or unfinished feature. Definitely not cool.</p>

<p>(One cool thing about <code>vobcopy</code>: as long as you complied with <code>libdvdread</code>, you can create a fully decrypted version of the DVD with</p>

<pre><code>vobcopy --mirror -i SOURCE
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, to get an iso image out of the decrypted mirror, you run the <code>hdiutil makehybrid -udf</code> command given above.)</p>

<hr />

<p>So <code>vobcopy</code> is dead (for copying specific titles in unfortunate DVDs). What&rsquo;s next?</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s <code>dvdbackup</code>. The man page is good, and <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/dvdbackup#A_single_title">ArchWiki</a> is even better (<em>ArchWiki is awesome!</em>), providing you cookbook solutions of combining the power of <code>dvdbackup</code> and <code>dvdauthor</code> (cookbooks are nice when dealing with unexciting technologies like DVD). In fact, <code>dvdbackup</code> alone is enough for extracting the VOBs of relatively small titles (&lt; 1GiB):</p>

<pre><code>dvdbackup -i SOURCE -o VOB_TARGET_DIR -t TITLE_NUMBER -n TITLE_NAME
</code></pre>

<p>then grab your title-specific VOB in <code>VOB_TARGET_DIR/TITLE_NAME/VIDEO_TS</code>. Unlike <code>vobcopy</code>&rsquo;s <code>-n/--title-number</code> option, <code>dvdbackup</code>&rsquo;s <code>-t/--title</code> option does it right, trimming everything else. However, there&rsquo;s a problem when the title is larger than 1 GiB — then <code>dvdbackup</code> will split the VOB into several 1 GiB max pieces, and there&rsquo;s no way to disable this (since <code>dvdbackup</code> is targeting a DVD player — ancient technology — rather than <code>mpv</code> or whatever). What&rsquo;s sadder is that I can&rsquo;t seem to combine the split VOBs with FFmpeg stream copy — <code>pcm_dvd</code> audio always gets converted to <code>mp2</code> and fails when I use <code>-c copy</code>. I&rsquo;m not a codec expert, but I suppose this is due to the fact that <code>pcm_dvd</code> isn&rsquo;t a supported encoding codec of FFmpeg (at least not my FFmpeg):</p>

<pre><code>&gt; ffmpeg -codecs | grep pcm_dvd
D.A..S pcm_dvd              PCM signed 20|24-bit big-endian
</code></pre>

<p><code>D</code> is for &ldquo;Decoding supported&rdquo;, <code>A</code> is for &ldquo;Audio codec&rdquo;, <code>S</code> is for &ldquo;Lossless compression&rdquo; — no encoding support. By the way, my FFmpeg is <code>brew</code>ed with the options <code>--with-fdk-aac</code>, <code>--with-ffplay</code>, <code>--with-freetype</code>, <code>--with-libass</code>, <code>--with-libbluray</code>, <code>--with-openjpeg</code>, <code>--with-openssl</code>, <code>--with-x265</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; \ffmpeg -version

</code></pre>

<p>Maybe I missed some <code>--enable</code>.</p>

<p>Sorry for the digression. So, it&rsquo;s not possible to stream-copy-concat the VOBs with FFmpeg. (In fact, since audio quality is not that important — you won&rsquo;t be able to tell 256k AAC from lossless anyway, especially when you are focusing on the video, so you can always transcode <code>pcm_dvd</code> into 256k AAC with <code>-c:a libfdk_aac -b:a 256k</code>. <code>mpeg2video</code> is an encoding supported codec so stream copy works fine. Or you may also use <code>flac</code> or whatever encoding-supported lossless codec.) However, if you insist on getting the original <code>pcm_dvd</code>, there is a way, an ugly way. You&rsquo;ve gotta be creative here. <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/dvdbackup#A_single_title">ArchWiki</a> already provides a cookbook solution on how to use <code>dvdbackup</code> and <code>dvdauthor</code> to create a DVD with a selected title. And <code>vobcopy</code> can copy the entire thing just fine, without the 1 GiB limit (make sure to use the <code>-l/--large-file</code> option if the size is greater than 2 GiB). Therefore, you can create a DVD with selected title from the original DVD, then <code>vobcopy</code> from the new DVD. This is insane, but it works, I&rsquo;ve tested that. <strong>Note, however, that timestamps might be wrong with <code>vobcopy</code>, so the VOB runs just fine linearly but might run into problems when you seek.</strong> Therefore, FFmpeg is still the way to go. Or maybe you can do it right with one click using some closed source software ☹ — I&rsquo;ve heard about success stories with the long ceased DVD Decrypter Windows project. In reality, I guess only people with theoretical interest or OCD will ever do this — FLAC or AAC should serve everyone just fine. It should have worked with <code>vobcopy</code> alone, but it doesn&rsquo;t. Hence the workaround.</p>

<hr />

<p>For future reference, I&rsquo;ll translate the ArchWiki cookbook solution here (it&rsquo;s too cookbook itself, specifying paths like <code>~/movie_name</code> and using unnecessary <code>cd</code>) about creating a title-specific DVD from a multi-title DVD (replace <code>SOURCE</code>, <code>VOB_TARGET_DIR</code>, <code>DVD_TARGET_DIR</code>, <code>TITLE_NUMBER</code>, and <code>TITLE_NAME</code> with sane values):</p>

<pre><code>dvdbackup -i SOURCE -o VOB_TARGET_DIR -t TITLE_NUMBER -n TITLE_NAME
dvdauthor -t -o DVD_TARGET_DIR VOB_TARGET_DIR/TITLE_NAME/VIDEO_TS/*.VOB
export VIDEO_FORMAT=NTSC
cd DVD_TARGET_DIR/VIDEO_TS &amp;&amp; dvdauthor -T -o DVD_TARGET_DIR
</code></pre>

<p><code>export VIDEO_FORMAT=NTSC</code> is to avoid the <code>dvdauthor</code> error of &ldquo;no default video format, must explicitly specify NTSC or PAL&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m not sure about the difference between NTSC and PAL, but I saw NTSC printed on my DVD, so I used it). And there you go, a shiny new DVD filesystem located in <code>DVD_TARGET_DIR</code>. (Note that unlike <code>vobcopy</code>, <code>dvdbackup</code> doesn&rsquo;t feature a nice progress bar even when <code>-v/--verbose</code> and <code>-p/--progress</code> are specified.) Then you can</p>

<pre><code>vobcopy -l DVD_TARGET_DIR
</code></pre>

<p>if you&rsquo;d like to. Recall that timestamps might be wrong, sadly.</p>

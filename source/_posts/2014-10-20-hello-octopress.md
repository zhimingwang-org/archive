This post marks my transition from Tumblr to Octopress & GitHub Pages.

I've been microblogging for a while at [zshello3.tumblr.com](http://zshello3.tumblr.com) for a while and I liked it. Not because of readers, which I suspect I have none; but there are certainly a huge amount of information I want to dump off my mind. Back in the days I *loved* my handwritten journals, and I really poured a lot into them. Peers were usually amazed when they saw my journals. These days typing seems to be a more robust solution to keeping my thoughts, especially when the thoughts are mostly technical.

Tumblr is awesome. Compared to WordPress (.com for pedantic people), it is both lightweight and beautiful (you get all the customization for free), so you quickly get to the writing. However, it is not designed for geeks, so

* Customization is capped at some point;
* I had the impression that the Markdown parser is herrendous;
* Email publishing is a mightmare, by the way;
* Code rendering always falls short â€” unless I spend a lot of time customizing (I'm pretty bad at HTML, CSS, and JS stuff).

Speaking of the last point, I've always been envious of the beautiful code blocks found on Octopress blogs. So here I come!

(Let me give it a try first.)

``` C hello.c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    printf("Hello, Octopress!\n")
}
```

Gorgeous. I'll get to the theme customization later. I'm actually busy as crazy this week.

Before I close this post, let me also try to embed a random gist I authored yesterday (for brewing):

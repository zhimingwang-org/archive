Finally it's here. According to [MacRumors](http://www.macrumors.com/2015/06/26/hidden-features-in-ios-9-and-os-x-el-capitan/):

> Apple's introduced a wide range of feature additions and minor tweaks in iOS 9 that make some very useful improvements to iOS. For example, there's now a Notification Center widget that displays the battery life of connected devices like the Apple Watch, and **there's a search bar in the Settings app that lets you find a specific setting very quickly.**

Good to see [my wish](/blog/2015-05-06-searchable-settings-are-one-honking-great-idea-lets-do-more-of-those.html) granted.

I submitted this blog to Apple via [News Publisher](https://developer.apple.com/news-publisher/) a few days after the WWDC keynote, just to get a feel for the submission process. It was easy; basically I just needed to provide an [Atom 1.0](/atom.xml) or [RSS 2.0](/rss.xml) feed, both of which I already have anyway.[^care] I was told at the end of the submission process that my submission would be reviewed.

[^care]: Of course my content isn't really optimized for the Apple News format, but why would I care.

Just now, quite surprisingly, I got the acceptance email from News Publisher:

The link to my channel appears to be

> <https://news.apple.com/TdEf82WUNSQeNOsvYyyu48Q>

But at the time of writing, trying to open this page just turns up a "sorry, this item isn't available in Apple News". Not sure if the page hasn't been updated, or if I really need an iOS 9 device to access. My current guess is the former — there's no reason Apple won't provide a channel preview in good ol' HTML.[^guess] I don't have an iOS 9 device yet, so I don't know how well my content, especially preformatted code blocks, will fare in News. Either way I won't adjust my content, but it would be fun to see the capabilities of Apple's official "RSS reader".

[^guess]: Or maybe they will only open up regular browser traffic after iOS 9 stable is released.

*June 30, 2015 update:* The page has been updated, and now the message makes much more sense:

![Apple News is coming soon. This channel or topic is only available in Apple News.](/img/20150630-dl-cmplnts-on-apple-news.png)

Quick tip: if the Digital Crown on your Apple Watch *all of a sudden*[^sudden] feels too tight and doesn't turn smoothly, probably it was somehow over-turned (and probably because you played with watchOS 2 Time Travel, as I did). I don't know how that happened because it's clearly not supposed to happen, but turning it in the easy-to-turn direction for a few rounds fixed the tightness issue for me.

There's also an [Apple Support document](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204639) on troubleshooting and cleaning the Digital Crown, if the above doesn't help.

[^sudden]: Especially after upgrading to watchOS 2. Why in the hell could upgrading the software screw up the hardware? You'll see a possible cause if you read on.

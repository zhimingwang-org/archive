iTunes keeps a "Previous Mobile Applications" folder of questionable value, which always annoys me. It eats into disk space and wastes syncing/backup cycles and bandwidth; you can easily find horror stories online about [100GB+ PMA folders](http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/5-years-of-deleted-iphone-apps-accumulated-in-my-itunes-library.1781676/#post-19749496). The value? You might be able to roll back to an earlier version, or restore an app pulled from the App Store. Really? I never had that need in my life[^disclosure]; have you? Worst of all, there should be a periodic clean up option â€” just like how deleted mail are automatically purged after one month, but the option is missing.

[^disclosure]: Full disclosure: unlike many people, I'm not very obsessed with my phone, and I only have about two dozen third-party apps.

Therefore, I wrote a trivial Python script to do the periodic cleanup. Feel free to grab my script below (also available at <http://git.io/previous-mobile-applications>) to save a few minutes of hacking. It should be plugged into a daily or weekly or monthly cron job (or the equivalent), and it writes data to `~/.local/share/itunes/previous-mobile-applications.json` by default. To customize, just modify the global constants.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

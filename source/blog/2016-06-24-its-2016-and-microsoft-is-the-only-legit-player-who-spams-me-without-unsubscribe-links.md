I'm so tired of Microsoft spam. Microsoft is known for being intrusive accross the board, and their newsletters are no different: I literally can't name one legit company in this day and age who doesn't put unsubscribe links in newsletters.[^amazon] I get "Azure pricing and services updates" newsletters all the time, as well as "exciting news" from Windows Insider Program (which doesn't excite me at all) every once in a short while.[^insider] I still occasionally receive random Chinese language promotions of Windows, presumably because I used a Windows Phone as my secondary phone for three months back home in the summer of 2013 (which was a horrible experience). Why Microsoft hasn't been regulated for spam yet, I do not know.

[^amazon]: To be fair, Amazon used to force promotional email on student members, but (if memory serves) I haven't seen one in ages.

[^insider]: "If you wish to stop receiving Windows Insider Program emails, you will need to leave the program." I guess that's the price of downloading a couple of Windows 10 insider builds.

A week ago I wrote a post [*Help Mou hit 1.0*](blog/2014/10/20/help-mou-hit-1-dot-0/). Today, I'm delighted to find out that Mou has reached its goal, $20,000, half way into the fundraiser.

So what do I expect from 1.0? Most importantly,

* CommonMark support, especially GFM fenced code block and saner nested structures;
* Custom Markdown engine (I would like to call [`stmd`](https://github.com/jgm/CommonMark)).

Whatever the case, Emacs is still my best friend.

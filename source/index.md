## About me

I am an undergrad at Stanford (junior as of May 2015) studying mathematics and theoretical physics. I enjoy coding in my spare time, for fun and profit (getting things done). I am lazy in general so I try to automate things as much as possible.

My first programming language was Pascal and I consider C my mother tongue, but recently I write most of my stuff in Python or non-interactive Bash, and I'm slowly moving to Zsh even for non-interactive shell scripting. My operating system is OS X, my text editor is Emacs, my interactive shell is Zsh, my package manager is Homebrew, and my default browser (at the moment — it changes a lot) is Google Chrome. I use four-space indents when the target language has no highly established convention that says otherwise. My public key is [here](/key.html), or you may find me on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/zmwangx). You won't and likely never will find me on SNS. What else is there to tell?

This blog could be about anything, but most of the stuff should be technical. Oh yes, this blog is fully open source, down to how image assets were generated. All tools necessary for reproducing this blog are either in or documented in [the source branch](https://github.com/zmwangx/zmwangx.github.io/tree/source) of [zmwangx/zmwangx.github.io](https://github.com/zmwangx/zmwangx.github.io).

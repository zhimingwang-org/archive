## About me

I am an undergrad at Stanford (junior as of May 2015) studying mathematics and theoretical physics. I enjoy coding in my spare time, for fun and profit (getting things done). I am lazy in general so I try to automate things as much as possible.

My first programming language was Pascal and I consider C my mother tongue, but recently I write my code in Python or Bash (non-interactive) most of the time. My operating system is OS X, my text editor is Emacs, my interactive shell is Zsh, my package manager is Homebrew, and my default browser (at the moment â€” it changes a lot) is Google Chrome. I use four-space indents. What else is there to tell?

This blog could be about anything, but most of the stuff should be technical.

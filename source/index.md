## About me

I am an undergrad at Stanford (junior as of May 2015) studying mathematics and theoretical physics. I enjoy coding in my spare time, for fun and profit (getting things done). I am lazy in general so I try to automate things as much as possible.

My first programming language was Pascal and I consider C my mother tongue, but recently I write my code in Python or Bash (non-interactive) most of the time. My text editor is Emacs, and my interactive shell is Zsh. I use four-space indents. What else is there to tell?

The blog could be about anything, but most of the stuff should be technical.

<p>Ars Technica <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/08/open-source-typeface-hack-brings-design-to-source-code/">just ran a piece</a> on the open source programming font <a href="https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack">Hack</a>. Now I don't really know why this is news-worthy (open source programming fonts aren't a new thing), but I thought I'd give it a try.</p>
<p>The result is unsurprising. I've loved my 10pt non anti-aliased Monaco for years, beginning with the Pro profile of Terminal.app. In fact, I initially refused to use iTerm2 precisely because I can't reproduce my beloved typeface in it, until I found out the non anti-aliasing trick. This time again, Hack simply can't compete with my favorite font; see the screenshots below. Among other things, it is way too thick for my liking &#8212; the same problem that haunts a whole range of programming fonts. Note that Hack is <a href="https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack#about">supposed to</a> look good at 8px&#8211;12px according to its README, but I tested it at 9pt&#8211;12pt in iTerm2 (I know, pt is supposed to be larger than px, but I seriously doubt that anyone would want 8px or 6pt as their daily font size &#8212; and for that matter iTerm2 doesn't even allow me to go below 9pt, a pretty reasonable restriction, I'd say).</p>
<p>By the way, it is worth pointing out that the very same Monaco looks horrible at 9pt or 11pt, anti-aliased or not (same goes for 10pt anti-aliased). 10pt non anti-aliased Monaco is simply a miracle.</p>

<p>After quite a bit of work, I finally have a decent OS X provisioning system, capable of provisioning a blank OS X install (with Xcode and CLT) for development and everyday life.</p>
<p>Here it is: <a href="https://github.com/zmwangx/dotfiles/blob/master/provision"><code>zmwangx/dotfiles/provision</code></a>. In case the path changes in the future and invalidates the aforementioned URL, <a href="https://github.com/zmwangx/dotfiles/blob/d8e20b731583d69b380d422c8788f61cd4a4e211/provision">here</a> is the archived provisioning script at the current master. Of course the provisioning system is not a single script; it reads and executes modules from a <a href="https://github.com/zmwangx/dotfiles/tree/master/provision.d"><code>provision.d</code></a> directory, which in turn links into other specialized parts of the system.</p>
<p>Selling points:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Highly modular due to the <code>provision.d</code> structure. New provisioning scripts for specialized tools can be added at any time without complicating the rest of the system.</p></li>
<li><p>Graceful failure and easy error recovery. For most failures, running the provision once more fixes the issues. This is especially helpful when GitHub get DDoS'ed and loads of downloads fail, e.g., <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150825150044/https://status.github.com/messages">last night</a>, when I was sleeping with the provisioning system hard at work.</p></li>
<li><p>Very nice, colored console messages. Of course you'd expect that when half of the code is devoted to messaging...</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Thus far tested on OS X 10.10 and 10.11. Works pretty well. Of course OS X provisioning (with so many impossible-to-automate tasks) is still a hell lot harder than Linux provisioning, but hopefully this system will safe me a considerable amount of time and trouble during my at-least-twice-a-year clean OS installation and beta testing in VMs.</p>

<p>I just let out <a href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-08-20-ios-9-turn-off-wi-fi-assist.html">a load of complaints about iOS 9 beta</a> last night, but apparently forgot about one nice thing: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/?id=511">Safari content blocking</a>.</p>
<p>In this day and age, not being iOS/OS X developers ourselves won't stop the rest of us from obtaining ObjC/Swift source code.<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-08-20-i-installed-blockparty-and-the-only-thing-i-can-say-is-wow.html#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> I simply typed "Safari content blocker" into GitHub's search box, and there it popped, the most starred repo relevant to my search, <a href="https://github.com/krishkumar/BlockParty">krishkumar/BlockParty</a>. Thanks to Apple's new sideloading policy in Xcode 7, I was able to immediately test it out on my phone.</p>
<p>The effect is just amazing. In my few minutes of browsing, I did not seem to encounter a single ad (on various consistently ad-laden news sites). You should definitely give it a shot. What's even more amazing is that BlockParty's <a href="https://github.com/krishkumar/BlockParty/blob/master/RediffBlock/blockerList.json"><code>blockList.json</code></a>, at the time of writing, is only 1578 lines long &#8212; a JSON array with 197 objects. <strong>Only 197 rules, blocking 197 domains.</strong> Compare that to <a href="https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/easylist.txt">EasyList</a>, which at the moment is a <strong>48820 line monster</strong>. Of course, EasyList is much more fine-grained (<a href="https://adblockplus.org/blog/content-blocking-in-safari-9-and-ios-9-good-news-or-the-death-knell-of-ad-blocking-on-safari">as are AdBlockPlus's filtering mechanisms</a>); with BlockParty I can actually see some blank boxes that used to host ads. But still, very impressive. Many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/krishkumar">@krishkumar</a> for publishing BlockParty, and to <a href="https://medium.com/@searls/installing-a-content-blocker-on-ios-9-public-beta-a25b2b83848f">Justin Searls</a> for publishing a detailed tutorial.<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-08-20-i-installed-blockparty-and-the-only-thing-i-can-say-is-wow.html#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>197 domains made our online lives so miserable. Hmm.</p>
<div class="footnotes">

<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>Actually developing a Safari content blocker extension is as easy as writing a JSON blocker list, but I'm not sure if you need an app with a UI to support the extension.

<p>Seriously. Go to Settings-&gt;Cellular, and scroll all the way down to reveal the "Wi-Fi Assist" switch. See screenshot at the end of the post. You'll see a description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Automatically use cellular data when Wi-Fi connectivity is poor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Switch that off, if you occasionally have shitty Wi-Fi (that kinda works anyway) and at all care about your cellular data usage.</p>
<p>I'll tell my horror story now. Background info: I have unlimited voice and text plus 300 MB data per month, since I've got Wi-Fi almost everywhere I go. Granted, school Wi-Fi (especially dorm) is shitty and drops all the time, but I'm not a streaming-music-on-mobile person, so the Wi-Fi is mostly fine for checking emails, browsing the Web (yes, even <a href="http://murphyapps.co/blog/2015/6/24/an-hour-with-safari-content-blocker-in-ios-9">iMore</a> or <a href="http://blog.lmorchard.com/2015/07/22/the-verge-web-sucks/">The Verge</a> kind of Web), getting push notifications, or even downloading a few podcasts on the go. I usually end up using less than 200 MB of cellular data per month.</p>
<p>However, at the beginning of August (on iOS 9 Public Beta 2 at that time), I somehow managed to burn through 200 MB in four or five days, with consistent daily stats, <em>while I did nothing special, at least not actively</em>. The timing overlaps with when I got my Apple Watch; I don't know if that's a coincidence. Anyway, more than 90% of that usage was under System Services-&gt;Documents &amp; Sync, which I could do nothing about. I had to turn off cellular data until almost the end of my billing cycle, when I stumbled upon the "Wi-Fi Assist" setting. Since then, I only used 4.8 MB &#8212; with 1.5 MB for System Services &#8212; in four days. Hardly a coincidence, I'd say.</p>
<p>In fact, I was pretty delighted when I heard about the ability to auto fallback to LTE when one's on the fringe of Wi-Fi in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/?id=719">WWDC '15 Session 719</a> ("Your App and the Next Generation Networks"). However, without another likely suspect, I guess what happened in reality was that when I was sitting in the center of a shitty Wi-Fi, with the system trying to do some background job involving a network connection, it just kept trying to connect via LTE, which probably beat the shitty Wi-Fi consistently. It would be nice if one day our phones would be aware of our data plans (realize that not every one is on a $100/mo 15 GB plan) and throttle its usage wisely.</p>
<p>Anyway, I simply can't understand why the "Wi-Fi Assist" switch, a general system-wide option, appears at the end of Cellular settings, after all the per-app nickel-and-dime settings and statistics. It's nearly impossible to find. Generic settings should be at the top, period.</p>
<p>By the way, I have a lot of gripes about iOS 9 Beta. Maybe I shouldn't whine about beta software &#8212; I never used another iOS beta before so maybe they were even worse &#8212; but I can't help it because this was supposed to be a stability release. Several things immediately jumped to my mind (all present in the latest Public Beta 3), without even trying:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-06-26-ios-9-searchable-settings.html">Searchable settings</a> is a scam. Many items can't be found. For instance, good luck searching for "Wi-Fi Assist". I wonder if the search index is hand-crafted. Also, you can't pull down to search from any screen; you have to go back, back, back, back to the main settings screen, and even then it begins with your last search, even if you're done with it. Ewww.</p></li>
<li><p>Scrolling and switching screens feels janky (system-wide) even on iPhone 6 Plus, supposedly a powerhouse.</p></li>
<li><p>The Music app is indeed totally screwed up (this actually dates back to iOS 8.4). It's so much harder than previous versions.</p>
<p>Dude, give me my old UI with selectable categories on the bottom bar if I've turned off Apple Music, okay? Do I have to put up with the Radio and Connect tabs, completely useless for me? Switching categories &#8212; by which I mean artists, albums, songs genres, etc. &#8212; is infinitely harder now, because you have to scroll all the way up to the top of a category in order to reveal the category selector, which has a dropdown arrow outside but isn't really a dropdown.</p>
<p>And may I go straight to the artwork and playback control screen when I tap to play a song? Damn, when I select and play a song of course I want see the song front and center; don't treat me like an indecisive guy.</p>
<p>And may I kindly request that the artwork does not protrude to the status bar &#8212; you do realize some artworks have white or light backgrounds, rendering the status bar unreadable?</p>
<p>Recently I also noticed that all my old iTunes purchases are showing up and screwing my library. There used to be a switch in System Preferences, the right place for this kind of settings on iOS, but it's since be removed in favor of Apple Music stuff (not sure why they are mutually exclusive), and strangely put in the category switcher. Hell, this abomination is even documented in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204951">"Using the new Music app"</a>; here's <a href="https://i.imgur.com/RJKLqPo.jpg">Apple's official screenshot</a> showing off the stupid category switcher. For me without Apple Music, the switch says "Show iTunes Purchases" instead of "Show Music Available Offline". Pretty clear, huh, not bad. But don't bother, it does absolutely nothing for me.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I could go on and on and on, but I don't want to waste more time on this crap. The gist is that I'm not impressed by iOS 9 at all at the moment (oh, one thing positive: San Francisco is nice). Hopefully the final release would be in much better shape; but I don't see any hope for the Music mess &#8212; it's not likely to be cleaned up any time soon. I mourn for the old Music app, which is likely gone forever.</p>

<p>I always cringe when I see laymen discussing physics in comments sections of news websites. A typical situation: one commentator put together a sentence with all physics-sounding (kind of) terms he's ever heard of; the next commentator "agrees" with the previous one, adding something that sounds more reasonable (to folks who've never taken high school physics) but unfortunately violates the first law of thermodynamics; then yet another guy comes along and corrects both of the above in a pedagogic tone, with an argument that violates the second law of thermodymics...</p>
<p>I cringe even more when laymen discuss mathematics, but that's much rarer compared to physics.</p>
<p>Granted, mathematics (theoretical computer science included) and theoretical physics are probably the most abstract knowledge known to human beings, but I'm beginning to wonder if there are other professionals who would also cringe when I myself is discussing something outside my domain of expertise. Or when a better mathematician or physicist listens in on my baby talks with someone on the roughly same level.</p>

<p>This post is a note to self.</p>
<p>As a long time git user, I've always used lowercase commit messages (in the subject line). I never quite liked the idea of capitalized commit messages, which are seldom complete sentences (and they are never period-terminated). Similarly, I avoid capilatization like hell in comments, unless when I write complete sentences. By the way, there's a technical advantage of writing lowercase commit messages: I can easily tell my human-made commits from auto commits like merge and revert commits, because they always begin with a capitalized "Merge", "Revert", etc.</p>
<p>However, most of the projects I've contributed to seem to prefer capitalized commit messages, and by following my own habit, quite often I would go through the "oh crap I messed up the contribution guidelines" realization and had to amend my commits after the fact. Also, when I open a single-commit pull request on GitHub, the subject line of the commit message automatically becomes the subject line of the pull request, and I want my pull requests to have capitalized subject lines. Perhaps I come off as self-contradictory here: lowercase commit message, but capitalized PR subject? I don't know. Maybe a PR subject is more like a real "title". Also, I blame the font: lowercase subject lines don't look remotely as good in, say, Helvetica (which GitHub currently uses for PR and commit message subject lines), as in a good fixed width font, which is what I get when I run any <code>git-log</code> variant in a terminal.</p>
<p>Anyway, lowercase commit messages isn't a particularly strong preference of mine, so I'm happy to change my habit from this day onward. Anyone can feel free to tease me if they see me write a lowercase commit message again (unless its in the format <code>component: changes</code>). In light of this, I've already <a href="https://github.com/zmwangx/zmwangx.github.io/commit/297225f2ab8a6db4fe75643f511f52499b052aa7">changed the message format</a> of <code>pyblog</code>'s auto commits, which is how I generate this blog.</p>
<p>P.S. To be fair to me, <em>Pro Git</em>, the official git tutorial, <a href="https://github.com/progit/progit2/blob/6d9867ff2394cb8a08fa3e013b082a7ae547b8af/book/02-git-basics/sections/viewing-history.asc#viewing-the-commit-history">uses lowercase commit messages</a> (I guess that's just the personal preference of Scott Chacon &#8212; not mandated by anyone). To be fair to the other side, <a href="https://github.com/git/git/commit/e83c5163316f89bfbde7d9ab23ca2e25604af290"><code>git.git</code> mostly uses capitalized commit messages</a>.</p>

<p>These days everyone seems to be talking about how complicated iTunes is and how Apple should give it a clean-sheet rewrite. This is not new, but the argument has certainly intensified ever since the introduction of iCloud Photo Library and Apple Music. For one recent example, see <a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/07/26/dont-order-the-fish">Don't order the fish</a> by Marco Arment. I was listening to John Gruber's <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2015/07/29/ep-127">The Talk Show episode 127</a> earlier today (a little bit late to the game, yeah), and the complexity argument was brought up yet again.</p>
<p>I just can't buy that argument. (Disclaimer: in this post I'm talking about UI/UX, not the backend.) Granted, there are many tabs in iTunes. There's one for music, one for movies, one for TV shows, one for podcasts, one for iOS apps, one for each iOS device currently connected via USB, and so on. You can hide some of them if you don't use them. And for each of these tabs there are probably subtabs, and occasionally a sidebar. This might sound rather intimidating to the faint-hearted, but if you really dive into iTunes, you'll find that 99% of the functionalities you'll ever need to find or organize your stuff are under four clicks away<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-08-05-should-apple-split-up-itunes-on-os-x.html#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, and editing metadata (including batch editing) is pretty easy too. All in all, iTunes as it currently stands is both powerful (too many things on the plate, in some people's words) and not badly complicated, in the sense that you can certainly find your way around if you try. Some would argue that some of iTunes' features get shuffled into different places from version to version; yeah that's annoying, but in reality it usually takes less than five minutes to find all I need in a new version.</p>
<p>For people who just buy their content from iTunes Store<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-08-05-should-apple-split-up-itunes-on-os-x.html#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and never organize again, there are probably too many unnecessary subtabs and sidebars, but hey, do they need to touch these controls at all? There's a search bar that works reasonably well accross the entire content library<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-08-05-should-apple-split-up-itunes-on-os-x.html#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. For people who do organize their stuff, or do routinely import music and videos from outside, or do sync their devices via USB, most of those controls are great and necessary.</p>
<p>One disclaimer, by the way: maybe Apple Music made things more confusing. I don't know because I didn't even sign up for the free trial.</p>
<p>Now think about splitting up iTunes. As on iOS, you get a Music app, a Videos app, a Podcast app, an iTunes U app, and a separate iTunes Store app. Probably yet another one for managing your iOS devices, since that belongs to none of the above. So, what do you save by having all those apps? You save one click when you switch focus to another area? Well, not even that at times: now you need to switch apps. Moreover, what if I use several of those routinely (I do)? Do I have to keep all of them on my dock? Even if I don't keep them in Dock, as long as they're open they'll show up anyway, and that would be beyond horrible for people who care about their docks. This is my current dock:</p>

<p>iTunes, where I playback music and manage my entire content library<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-08-05-should-apple-split-up-itunes-on-os-x.html#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, nicely takes up only one slot, which is the most reasonable thing to have. On iOS where apps can't have too many tabs or subtabs, it certainly makes sense to split the functionalities; on OS X where you do have space to host those tabs or subtabs, I fail to see how complexity warrants refactoring, especially when refactoring would introduce other problems.<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-08-05-should-apple-split-up-itunes-on-os-x.html#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> <a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-08-05-should-apple-split-up-itunes-on-os-x.html#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Speaking of complexity, iTunes isn't even remotely as complex as, say, Microsoft Word or Adobe Photoshop. Those are of course nightmares to most people, but the point is that iTunes isn't a nightmare &#8212; it's pretty manageable, especially to power users and developers, who are the ones complaining most loudly. Also, nothing can beat the complexity of the web browser. We browse all kinds of web pages and use all kinds of web apps everyday, all inside the browser, which can hold arbitrarily many tabs with completely different UIs. We don't complain about the browser. Then why do we complain about iTunes, which is a consistent mix of essential functionalities across different areas of our multimedia experience?</p>
<p>It's true that everyone has their iTunes pet peeves. For instance, I hate the stupid new icon and the useless Apple Music related tabs that I can't turn off in 12.2. The biggest gripe I have with 12.2 is probably the small, hardly noticeable rotating circle at the far upper-right corner of the window,<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-08-05-should-apple-split-up-itunes-on-os-x.html#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> which now hosts the progress indicators of certain IO operations such as downloads and copying files to devices. To me it's a step backwards. Previously downloads was in a separate popup window and file copying had a place in the central area, visible whichever app you are in, but now I have to look for the visual indicator and all of a sudden remember that oh, it has been moved to that remote corner; even then I have to keep focus on iTunes, or the progress indicator dropdown would disappear. It seems all random that the progress of device syncing (and any copy operations initiated as part of the sync) should be front and center, while manually copying files to apps should retreat to the corner. Nevertheless, these minor or not-so-minor annoyances (honestly annoyances exist in almost every app) doesn't justify an iOS-like approach, which has its own drawbacks. I would be really mad if one day I need to run multiple apps just to manage the stuff on my phone.</p>

<p><strong>08/11/2015 Update:</strong> I have taken down the project from GitHub since it's way too flaky. Guess I'll stick with manually clicking around then...</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/zmwangx/safari-sync-chrome-bookmarks">zmwangx/safari-sync-chrome-bookmarks</a> (now defunct; see update above).</p>
<hr/>
<p>I've been reading quite a bit of stuff on my iPhone 6 Plus these days, especially since I got my Apple Watch (not quite sure why these two things are correlated, but they are). I used to read subscribed content in Feedly, but abandoned that a while ago since Feedly does an unbearably bad job at updating my one-subscriber feeds,<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-08-02-sync-chrome-bookmarks-with-safari-on-os-x.html#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> e.g., Ars Premier feed, GitHub release feeds, etc. Ever since then, I've been rocking a local Leaf engine on my Mac but lost access on my phone,<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-08-02-sync-chrome-bookmarks-with-safari-on-os-x.html#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and had to rely on bookmarks.</p>
<p>However, as a Chrome user on the desktop and only on the desktop (iOS Chrome sucks), I have trouble getting my Chrome bookmarks into mobile Safari. Apple developed an <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/icloud-bookmarks/fkepacicchenbjecpbpbclokcabebhah?hl=en">iCloud Bookmarks</a> extension for Chrome that allegedly syncs your bookmarks to iCloud<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-08-02-sync-chrome-bookmarks-with-safari-on-os-x.html#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, but upon installing the extension for Mac Chrome, an error message pops up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The extension you are trying to install is designed to run on Windows 7 or 8. If you are using a Mac, your Safari bookmarks will automatically sync with your iPhone, iPad, and Mac when you sign in to iCloud on all your devices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The message is pretty clear: you have access to our browser, so you either use our browser or go fuck yourself.</p>
<p>So, what's next? Fortunately, recent versions of Safari (I'm currently running 8.0.7) has an import feature that comes in handy and does a pretty good job: "File -&gt; Import From -&gt; Google Chrome..." which lets you import either history or bookmarks or both. Once they are imported into desktop Safari, iCloud is pretty good at pushing it to mobile. I have no problem importing both, but the idea that I'll have to launch Safari and click click click click just to sync my bookmarks is beyond horrible.</p>
<p>Okay, remember we have another nightmare called AppleScript? And remember we have another nightmare within nightmare called GUI scripting? Yes, here's what we could do:</p>
<pre class="applescript"><code>#!/usr/bin/osascript
tell application "Safari" to activate
delay 1
tell application "System Events"
    tell process "Safari"
        tell menu bar 1
            tell menu bar item "File"
                tell menu "File"
                    tell menu item "Import From"
                        tell menu "Import From"
                            click menu item "Google Chrome&#8230;"
                            delay 1
                            keystroke return
                        end tell
                    end tell
                end tell
            end tell
        end tell
    end tell
end tell
delay 1
tell application "Safari" to quit</code></pre>
<p>Holy crap, look at that cascade.<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-08-02-sync-chrome-bookmarks-with-safari-on-os-x.html#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Anyway, in principle, this piece of crap works. In reality, well, it <em>sometimes</em> works. Because you know the nightmare called "assistive access", among other unreliabilities of poking around with system events:</p>
<div class="figure">
<a href="http://zmwangx.github.io/img/20150802-assistive-access-nightmare.png" target="_blank"><img alt="Familiar?" src="http://zmwangx.github.io/img/20150802-assistive-access-nightmare.png"/></a>
<p class="caption">Familiar?</p>
</div>
<p>On Yosemite at least, the pane to grant assistive access in System Preferences is three levels deep ("Security &amp; Privacy -&gt; Privacy -&gt; Accessibility"), behind an admin password, and most unfortunately, there's no way to grant access to individual executables through that pane, unless you are explicitly prompted about one, which may not happen when it should.<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-08-02-sync-chrome-bookmarks-with-safari-on-os-x.html#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> <a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-08-02-sync-chrome-bookmarks-with-safari-on-os-x.html#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> There's nothing I could do apart from granting access to both Terminal.app and iTerm.app and hope for the best. Not so surprisingly, just as demonstrated in my past encounters with GUI scripting, with access granted to the terminals, whether I'll get an "assitive access" error when running the script is completely hit-or-miss. This time it works, the next time it just stalls, and yet another time it emits the error... Oh god.</p>
<p>In order to raise the rate of success, there's one other trick we could try: package the script into an Automator app. This way we can grant access to the standalone app, and that helps a bit. That's what I did in <a href="https://github.com/zmwangx/safari-sync-chrome-bookmarks">zmwangx/safari-sync-chrome-bookmarks</a>. It still occasionally get stuck, probably because I have a freaking slow spinning HDD and Safari would sometimes take forever to launch; but the accessibility problem does seem to go away (provided that you re-grant access every time you make the tiniest modification to the app).</p>
<p>Now I can throw that into my crontab (launching Safari beforehand to avoid freezing up):</p>
<pre class="crontab"><code>55 04 * * * open -g -a safari &amp;&amp; sleep 30 &amp;&amp; open -g -a safari-sync-chrome-bookmarks</code></pre>
<p>or invoke on demand.</p>
<p>Horrible solution, yes. Anything better? I would love to hear about it, but I highly doubt there's any, unless we directly work with <code>~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Bookmarks</code> and <code>~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist</code>. Probably a good problem to tackle though, provided that someone would sit down and understand the formats of the two files.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>I can understand that to reduce server load, they can't refresh the one-subscriber feeds at a rate, say, once per minute, but not being able to manually update, especially when you have a so-called "refresh" feature? Not cool. (What the manual "refresh" seems to do is to fetch Feedly's cached content.) Anyway, it's a freemium service with me running the free tier, so I can't really blame them.<a class="footnotes-backlink" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-08-02-sync-chrome-bookmarks-with-safari-on-os-x.html#fnref1">&#8617;&#65038;</a></p></li>

<p>I was listening to <a href="http://atp.fm/episodes/128">Accidental Tech Podcast E128</a> today, which discussed the implications of Rootless (i.e. System Integrity Protection) at quite some length.<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-07-30-the-sad-state-of-finder-on-el-capitan.html#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Which stirred up my old worries about the Finder &#8212; I was briefly concerned about TotalFinder immediately after Rootless was announced in WWDC, but was quickly reassured and forgot that concern after learning that Homebrew (i.e. <code>/usr/local</code>) isn't affected, which attracted more of my attention.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the concern is real. TotalFinder is dead on El Capitan: it has been monkey patching Finder.app all along, and that strategy apparently is killed by Rootless. BinaryAge has <a href="http://blog.binaryage.com/el-capitan-update/">announced</a> that TotalFinder won't be ported to El Capitan. It's a done deal.</p>
<p>This is actually not the first time I felt threatened as a TotalFinder fan<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-07-30-the-sad-state-of-finder-on-el-capitan.html#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. Back in 2013, when Finder tabs was announced for Mavericks, there were <a href="http://discuss.binaryage.com/t/call-for-ideas-what-should-be-the-next-binaryage-product/243">hints from BinaryAge</a> that TotalFinder might be discontinued one day, because apparently Finder tabs is a "serious hit for our [BinaryAge's] business". However, it still survived all the way up till Yosemite. I had the hope that TotalFinder could die a peaceful, glorious death when Apple finally improved the stock Finder to a certain point; I didn't quite expect TotalFinder to die an abrupt death like this.</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, my expectations for Finder isn't very high. Just provide the following and I'll be pretty happy:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Auto-resize each column (one can already "Right Size All Columns Individually" through the right-click context menu from the column dividers &#8212; is it that hard or unreasonable to make that automatic?);</li>
<li>A way to quickly show and hide hidden files without leaving Finder;</li>
<li>Folders on top (when not sorting by kind) is a nice addition, but not a must;</li>
<li>Chrome-styled tab (instead of Safari-styled) would be a plus.</li>
</ol>
<p>Pretty simple, aren't they (except point 4, which won't happen in stock Finder for the forseeable future)? Especially point 1, which should be desirable for all users, power users and dummies alike. If TotalFinder (and the free alternative XtraFinder, for that matter) can do these just by monkey patching, then Apple with all the control and infinite resources definitely could do these.</p>
<p>Anyway, complaints aren't going to get me anywhere. What's next?</p>
<p>TotalFinder is dead.</p>
<p>XtraFinder<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-07-30-the-sad-state-of-finder-on-el-capitan.html#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> similarly monkey patches Finder, so it also won't work with Rootless enabled. The developer has no plan to drop its support though, and I've confirmed that so far the lastest version works well on El Capitan PB3 without Rootless, save for the auto-resize columns feature, which somehow has no effect. Hopefully it will be fixed.</p>
<p>The only other well-known Finder alternative is probably Path Finder, but being a standalone program<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-07-30-the-sad-state-of-finder-on-el-capitan.html#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> priced at $39.95, it seems both too full-blown and too expensive. Also, the "Path Finder 7" and "Upgrade &#8212; $19.95" on <a href="http://www.cocoatech.com/pathfinder/">the project's home page</a> aren't reassuring; it's probably a $20 per year program.<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-07-30-the-sad-state-of-finder-on-el-capitan.html#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Moreover, even if I end up paying the money, I'm not even sure if it is going to be able to fully replace the experience around Finder. For instance, does the <code>open</code> command open directories in PathFinder? I highly doubt that. Not to mention my AppleScripts surrounding Finder. Heck, I just want a nicer Finder; why am I forced to a full (and probably not fully integrated) replacement.</p>
<p>Besides, Path Finder's roadmap is pretty ridiculous. A guy asked "<a href="http://support.cocoatech.com/discussions/problems/33611-will-path-finder-work-with-el-capitan">Will Path Finder work with El Capitan?</a>" on the support forum, and the reply was</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, I cannot provide you with any information regarding this at the moment. We will let you know once there will be an official release of Mac OS X El Capitan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seriously? That sounds so last decade. Which developer is so tight-lipped today? And who waits for the final OS release only to announce the support schedule? If they can't keep up with the schedule (or haven't evaluated the situation yet), at least they can communicate honestly with customers. This kind of uncertainty will only drive people away. Hard to believe this is the support you get for $40 plus upgrade fees.</p>
<p>I don't know what I'll do in the end. Path Finder is probably not what I'm looking for, but maybe I'll give it a spin if they release an El Capitan ready version in time. Most likely though, I'll stick to stock Finder for a while, and if it turns out too painful, I'll just disable Rootless and sport a copy of XtraFinder. I don't think Rootless will be that useful for me anyway; I still believe it's game over once malware sneaks into my system, whatever privilege it claims. Whether Apple will further lock down the system in a future version is another story.</p>

<p>I was browsing <a href="https://github.com/github/hub">github/hub</a>, and noticed something funny in the issue tracker:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Attach more than just images: Now you can attach PDF, <strong>Word</strong>, and <strong>PowerPoint</strong> files to your comments on Issues and Pull Requests.

<p>For a moment I wondered if today's April Fools', but apparently it isn't. Which makes me wonder: is GitHub expanding its customer base to grandparents? Or is this a heavily demanded feature on GitHub Enterprise by nontechnical managers and sales personnel? Attaching PDF to issues and PRs is already laughable enough; I just can't imagine any developer asking for Microsoft Office support. I mean, what should we do with those? Download those crap, wait ten minutes for Microsoft applications to launch, just to read a few pages of text? I know GitHub is expanding to designers by rolling out features like PSD diffing<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-07-19-github-experimental-attachment-formats-pdf-docx-and-pptx.html#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and Large File Storage (<a href="https://git-lfs.github.com/"><code>git-lfs</code></a>) for assets, so is this feature also targeting nontechnical designers? Not sure. <strong>At any rate, this "feature" is simply ridiculous.</strong></p>
<p>GitHub has long been lacking good attachment support. Granted, one can dump files to gists and then link to them from issues, but that's a pain for most people (and not all people are aware of that). The lack of attachment support (other than images) is keeping some projects from hosting their issue trackers on GitHub, whose issue tracking system is otherwise extraodinary.<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-07-19-github-experimental-attachment-formats-pdf-docx-and-pptx.html#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> One notable example that I care about is <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/issues">iTerm2</a>, which asks users to attach the user preference plist and a gzipped debug log when opening a new bug. <strong>Therefore, GitHub should improve their attachment support by accepting plain text files<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-07-19-github-experimental-attachment-formats-pdf-docx-and-pptx.html#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, small gzips, common binary config file formats like binary Plist XML and so on that developers care about. But instead, they are working on... Microsoft Office???</strong></p>
<p>My attitude towards Microsoft Office (mostly Word) is best described in a gist/tutorial that I wrote more than a year ago: <a href="https://gist.github.com/zmwangx/9987772"><em>Markdown, LaTeX, etc.</em></a>. The <a href="https://gist.github.com/zmwangx/9987772#tips-for-microsoft-office-users">"Tips for Microsoft Office users"</a> section is quoted out in full at the end of this post. My feelings toward Microsoft, and by extension, Office, has softened quite a bit since I wrote that tutorial (in particular, unlimited OneDrive storage for Office 365 subscribers was a pretty good bribe), but every word in that section still applies to Microsoft Word. <strong>It is just sad that so many people all around the globe are still stuck in this Microsoft hell, not knowing that they have been liberated, and that they could have been free all along. And this move by GitHub is definitely not helping.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Appendix.</strong> From my tutorial <a href="https://gist.github.com/zmwangx/9987772"><em>Markdown, LaTeX, etc.</em></a>:</p>

<h3>
Why I hate Microsoft Office
</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Microsoft Office is non-free, free both as in "free speech" and "free beer."</p></li>
<li><p>Microsoft Office is not only non-free, but also expensive.</p></li>
<li><p><code>.docx</code> is proprietary format. Microsoft has full control over it (correct me if I'm wrong). Hopefully they at least released it as a standard, so vendor lock-in won't happen. However, Microsoft could change mind any time.</p></li>
<li><p>Most Microsoft Word documents are text documents. But they are not readable and editable at all with text editors (in principle you could read and edit XML, but seriously, who would bother to do that). <strong>So why Microsoft Office when plain text is nice, elegant, efficient, fast, and free?</strong> Even when you need some formatting, there are Markdown and other plain text, human readble, and open source formats. I really hate it when people send me docx or ask me to send docx. Why assume I have the crap proprietary software installed? You could at least save as PDF before sending to me.</p>
<p>(PDF is another story. It started as proprietary, but was released free of charge a long time ago, and has since been made an open standard. There are a good number of great open source PDF generators, PDFLaTeX being one notable example. And after all, PDF and PostScript are intended for printers &#8212; they are not so easily made human readable without an interpreter, so using a proprietary format in this setting is reasonable.)</p>
<p>You might argue that docx can be edited with LibreOffice, OpenOffice, etc. However, first of all, documents created by Microsoft Office are not always (always not) rendered the same in these Offices; 100% compatibility has never been achieved. If you choose to work with Microsoft Office documents, you either be cheap and worry about lock-out/lock-in/damage/permanent damage (people who love Microsoft Office are often not competent enough to do back-up right), or throw your money at Microsoft. And point is: <strong>plain text is both free and reliable in the first place.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Microsoft could change their pricing model at any time, just as Adobe did to their Creative Suite. They've already been exploring the subscription model via Office 365 for a while, which is $99.99 a year (home). In the future, Office might turn to subscription only, meaning that you would never have a full copy of your (already crappy) software that is guaranteed to work regardless of time, and that they could raise the subcription price at any time and drive you nuts instantly. (Microsoft recently released Office on iPad, which is already subscription only. Watch out for the trend.)</p></li>
<li><p>Forgot to highlight one major annoyance. As you already know, I hate Microsoft Office; however, as mentioned in 4, I'm forced to keep the crap installed and occasionally launch it (which takes something around ten minutes just to launch) thanks to other people who insist on Microsoft Office. Every single launch deepens the hatred.</p></li>
<li><p>(<em>05/04/2014</em> update) Apart from storage, transmission, and distribution, Microsoft Office &#8212; and word processors in general &#8212; are also bad for <em>writing</em>. To quote the <a href="http://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/">AsciiDoc official introduction</a>, the "Word processors, the real writer&#8217;s block" section,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you are in the writing (i.e., <a href="http://blog.stoyanstefanov.com/writing-vs-typing/">typing</a>) phase, you want the words to flow onto the screen with minimal distractions and interruptions. Flow, not just time, is essential.</p>
<p>Most word processor excel at distracting you from writing. The result: <em>you write less</em> (ironic, huh?).</p>
<p>In a word processor, before you can type the first word on a blank screen, you're forced to think about what font family you want, what font size you want, what lines spacing you want and so on. Once you do get going, auto-correct, spelling and grammar suggestions entice you to backtrack and lose your next thought. "Smart" quotes and auto-linking messes with the text as fast as you can enter it. If you paste text, it likely gets added to the document with a different font family, size and even color.</p>
<p><strong>Undo. Undo. Undo!</strong></p>
<p>Let's not even talk about inserting source code. The designers of word processors clearly did not.</p>
<p><strong>Format. Format. Format!</strong></p>
<p>After burning time fighting with its interface, you rightfully conclude that the word processor is trying to <em>sabotage</em> your writing process.</p>
<p><strong>We <em>need</em> an easier way to write!</strong></p>
<p>But how?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's kind of ironic to quote AsciiDoc in a document promoting Markdown, but at the very least, we are all against Word. This section is so well written that I can't resist the temptation to quote it out in full. Moreover, I actually typed it in myself to enjoy it to the fullest.</p></li>
<li><p>(<em>05/04/2014</em> update) By the way, there is more to quote against docx (and XML in general), this time from Linus Torvalds, in a <a href="https://plus.google.com/+LinusTorvalds/posts/X2XVf9Q7MfV">Google+ comment</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>no [sic], XML isn't even good for document markup.</p>
<p>Use 'asciidoc' for document markup. Really. It's actually <strong>readable</strong> by humans, and easier to parse and way more flexible than XML.</p>
<p>XML is crap. Really. There are no excuses. XML is nasty to parse for humans, and it's a disaster to parse even for computers. There's just no reason for that horrible crap to exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you don't believe in me, you certainly believe in Linus don't you, who is much better at this art than you and me. If you don't even believe in Linus, you are not my reader in mind anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>There are infinitely many other reasons to hate Microsoft Office, <strong>which grabs money from the most basic workflow &#8212; text editing</strong>. The reasons to hate Microsoft Office occur infinitely often in the decimal expansion of &#960;.</p></li>

<p>I submitted this blog to Apple via <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news-publisher/">News Publisher</a> a few days after the WWDC keynote, just to get a feel for the submission process. It was easy; basically I just needed to provide an <a href="http://zmwangx.github.io/atom.xml">Atom 1.0</a> or <a href="http://zmwangx.github.io/rss.xml">RSS 2.0</a> feed, both of which I already have anyway.<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-06-29-dl-cmplnts-in-apple-news.html#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> I was told at the end of the submission process that my submission would be reviewed.</p>
<p>Just now, quite surprisingly, I got the acceptance email from News Publisher:</p>

<p>But at the time of writing, trying to open this page just turns up a "sorry, this item isn't available in Apple News". Not sure if the page hasn't been updated, or if I really need an iOS 9 device to access. My current guess is the former &#8212; there's no reason Apple won't provide a channel preview in good ol' HTML.<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-06-29-dl-cmplnts-in-apple-news.html#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> I don't have an iOS 9 device yet, so I don't know how well my content, especially preformatted code blocks, will fare in News.

<p>iTunes keeps a "Previous Mobile Applications" folder of questionable value, which always annoys me. It eats into disk space and wastes syncing/backup cycles and bandwidth; you can easily find horror stories online about <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/5-years-of-deleted-iphone-apps-accumulated-in-my-itunes-library.1781676/#post-19749496">100GB+ PMA folders</a>. The value? You might be able to roll back to an earlier version, or restore an app pulled from the App Store. Really? I never had that need in my life<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-06-27-automatically-clean-up-previous-mobile-applications.html#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>; have you? Worst of all, there should be a periodic clean up option &#8212; just like how deleted mail are automatically purged after one month, but the option is missing.</p>
<p>Therefore, I wrote a trivial Python script to do the periodic cleanup. Feel free to grab my script below (also available at <a class="uri" href="http://git.io/previous-mobile-applications">http://git.io/previous-mobile-applications</a>) to save a few minutes of hacking. It should be plugged into a daily or weekly or monthly cron job (or the equivalent), and it writes data to <code>~/.local/share/itunes/previous-mobile-applications.json</code> by default. To customize, just modify the global constants.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apple's introduced a wide range of feature additions and minor tweaks in iOS 9 that make some very useful improvements to iOS. For example, there's now a Notification Center widget that displays the battery life of connected devices like the Apple Watch, and <strong>there's a search bar in the Settings app that lets you find a specific setting very quickly.</strong></p>

<p>The project I've been working on intermittently over the past month, <a href="https://github.com/zmwangx/pyonedrive"><code>pyonedrive</code></a>, a OneDrive API v1.0 API/CLI client, is now quite satisfactory in terms of its feature set<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-06-23-all-problems-solved.html#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, so today I'm thinking about what I should work on next. Of course there's <a href="https://github.com/zmwangx/pyonedrive/labels/enhancement">a lot more I can do</a>, but what is done already encapsulates 95%+ of my daily usage; moreover, as everyone knows, refining an existing project is not as exciting as starting a new one and making something happen that is previously tedious or impossible.</p>
<p>To my surprise, <em>I can't think of anything</em>. I now realized that I don't have many peculiar computing needs. I needed a storyboard generator which I couldn't find anywhere, <a href="https://github.com/zmwangx/storyboard">so I wrote one</a>, and got an <a href="https://storyboard.readthedocs.org/en/latest/metadata-cli.html">elegant FFprobe wrapper</a> for free. I hated the crappy CLI shipped with <a href="https://github.com/mk-fg/python-onedrive"><code>python-onedrive</code></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-06-23-all-problems-solved.html#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> that constantly fails and dumps, so I <a href="https://github.com/zmwangx/pyonedrive">rolled my own</a> around the new API. In the process of coding up these two things, I learned quite a bit of Python &#8212; the kind of things I would never learn by reading tutorials or references alone. Other than these two, I need to interact with a few Web services and scrape a few Web sites, which are easily taken care of in bash/zsh/python (node might better serve some, but they ain't broke, so why rewrite). I also need some other CLI tools but those have been solved by existing projects, probably started by people with similar needs. Some of them need some clean-up and feature boost, e.g., <a href="https://github.com/soimort/you-get"><code>you-get</code></a>, but I'm not inclined to refactor or submit substantial PRs to other people's projects, so I usually just write my own wrappers to bypass their limitations.<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-06-23-all-problems-solved.html#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> What else? Basically nothing.</p>
<p>So I'm in a strange situation that I feel like writing software for fun and profit, but don't have anything exciting to lay my hands upon (other than improving existing things). Of course I could learn my next language, but language learning without real world usage is likely to be futile. For instance, I would like to learn some Go or Rust, but why do I need a compiled, C/C++ replacement these days, when scripting takes care of all my personal needs? Not clear. Maybe it's a good time to concentrate on the real important things in my career.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Update: Whilst writing this post, I came up with a project after all. I always had the idea of keeping an encrypted journal &#8212; real encryption, not the fake "password protection" of DayOne.<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-06-23-all-problems-solved.html#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The journal should be decrypted &#8212; probably only into memory &#8212; upon entry (after securely typing in password), and each text/image object should be encrypted separately to ease syncing (so using an encrypted sparseimage won't work).</p>
<p>In principle an Emacs package should be able to do this, but going forward Elisp is a pretty horrible choice of language for anything substantial (think of, for example, threading, which there is none). Therefore, I'm inclined to write this in ObjC/Swift with Cocoa. This will be my first attempt at Cocoa programming, and my first serious involvement with Xcode (other than CLT, of course) after quite a few years<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-06-23-all-problems-solved.html#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>. Actually I've always been looking for an excuse to learn some Swift.</p>
<p>Oops, am I falling into <a href="https://sivers.org/zipit">prematurely announcing my plans</a>? Hopefully not.</p>

<p><em><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: While this post might have been triggered by a <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23distractinglysexy">specific</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-06-12-the-tip-of-the-iceberg.html#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> campaign, I'm certainly not addressing any specific concern or siding with any party. I never bothered to learn enough about a specific campaign to form a judgement that I would stand by,<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-06-12-the-tip-of-the-iceberg.html#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> since I simply don't care. I'm writing this post because I'm just too tired to see them popping up in my feeds every once in a while.</em></p>
<p><em>By the way, I'm not sure if I'm going to stand by this post when I wake up tomorrow morning. It will stay either way, though.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>I have the impression that these days there's at least one public shaming campaign going on every week, justified by political correctness, and serving as a great outlet for school or workplace frustration accumulated during the week. And every now and then, a woman or man<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-06-12-the-tip-of-the-iceberg.html#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> is destroyed by such a campaign, although all she or he did was to make a somewhat flippant yet universally true,<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-06-12-the-tip-of-the-iceberg.html#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> almost universally true, or at the very least, not-meant-to-be-offensive, remark.</p>
<p>On the face of it (e.g., retweet counts), you might be convinced that the world is seriously supportive of such campaigns. However, you have to realize that <em>the tens or even hundreds of thousands of campaigners are still just one tip of the iceberg called the society</em>. Behind every campaigner there are probably ten people holding opposite views, and one thousand who simply don't care either way<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-06-12-the-tip-of-the-iceberg.html#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>. Since political correctness is involved, how many people would you expect to be outspoken about their true opinions? Most likely people are muted by the fear of being politically wrong and being pursued and destroyed, just like the poor guy at the center of the storm. Moreover, I'm afraid that some (if not most) campaigners are not really offended, but just joining what they see as a hilarious ride &#8212; they don't mind if a woman or man is destroyed along the way. You know, humans can be unintentionally cruel to people not worth being cruel to. This statement also applies to some of the shaming campaign targets, but <em>being unintentionally cruel doesn't automatically make them worth being cruel to</em>.</p>
<div class="footnotes">
<hr/>
<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>In this case the campaign is too civilized to be called a shaming campaign.<a class="footnotes-backlink" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-06-12-the-tip-of-the-iceberg.html#fnref1">&#8617;&#65038;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>And I question if most shamers did.<a class="footnotes-backlink" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-06-12-the-tip-of-the-iceberg.html#fnref2">&#8617;&#65038;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Note how I have to be distracted from writing to consider the wording that should have been subconscious, and eventually write in this style.<a class="footnotes-backlink" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-06-12-the-tip-of-the-iceberg.html#fnref3">&#8617;&#65038;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Sometimes a certain group of people seek to redefine certain concepts or terms so that truths stated with older concepts or terms in mind are no longer true. That's fine. But before you label someone as an asshole, you have to realize that while you are free to embrace <em>your</em> modernity, some (if not most) people are just not as radical or as concerned about your topic, and they are just holding on to the truths and values they were taught.<a class="footnotes-backlink" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-06-12-the-tip-of-the-iceberg.html#fnref4">&#8617;&#65038;</a></p></li>

<p>I just restarted my machine (in the process of planning a fresh OS re-install), and something in Chrome's UI immediately felt wrong. After a few moments I realized it was the star button (bookmark button) in the far right of the omnibox giving me the uneasy feeling &#8212; the old bookmark system is back. Broadcasting from stable channel, build 43.0.2357.124 on OS X.</p>

<p class="caption">The heart sinking feeling when I saw this again.</p>
</div>
<p>I went to flags and made sure "Enable the new bookmark app system" wasn't tempered with. It wasn't. Anyway, I changed it to "Enabled" and restarted Chrome. No go, still the old crap. So I Googled my way to <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/mhIX5LB23As">the announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>Our team is committed to improving Chrome&#8217;s bookmarks experience, but for the time being, we&#8217;ve decided to bring back the previous version. Our team will continue to explore other ways to improve the bookmarks experience. You&#8217;ll see the previous version of the bookmarks manager return to your Chrome browser shortly.</p>
<p>For those of you who enjoyed using the new bookmarks manager, you can still keep the new experience by downloading the Bookmarks Manager extension from the Chrome Web Store.</p>
<p>We appreciate hearing all of your thoughtful feedback. Feel free to leave us with any additional comments here in this thread.</p>
<p>Best,<br/> The Chrome team</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is just very disappointing. My default browser changes a lot, but I've been tagging along with Opera for <a href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2014-12-14-the-google-chrome-comic-a-classic.html">almost the entirety of 2014</a>, so I've long been used to visual bookmarks. And honestly, it never felt weird or anything; I saw it as an improvement the first time I was introduced to the concept.</p>
<p>I know, there's always a demographic that would fiercely resist any change; they would reject anything new at a glance (or after using for a second) and start moaning right away, disregarding all the new benefits here and there. There's also another demographic who not only have no taste in design at all, but would also actively seek to tear down any visual enhancement &#8212; 90s visual is enough for them for life, any more is unsolicited and insulting. When these two demographics meet<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-06-10-chrome-disappointment-the-shabby-and-boring-old-bookmark-system-from-stone-age-strikes-back.html#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and somehow make the developers retreat, the outcome is simple and sad: <em>we can never have nice things.</em></p>
<p>I'm not saying I'm 100% satisfied with Chrome's visual bookmarks. In fact far from that. For one thing, Google is really pretty bad at visual design.<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-06-10-chrome-disappointment-the-shabby-and-boring-old-bookmark-system-from-stone-age-strikes-back.html#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Also, not being able to adjust tile size or toggle a list view is rather lame. However, whatever problems there are, the new system is at least 200% better than the old one (just look that the screenshots!).<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-06-10-chrome-disappointment-the-shabby-and-boring-old-bookmark-system-from-stone-age-strikes-back.html#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> <em>The team should focus on making the new system better,</em> such as implementing the features I mentioned above, rather than throw it into the trash can and resurrect the old system from Stone Age.</p>
<p>I know, throwing things away is part of Google's philosophy. They usually toy with a wide range of ideas and discard the ones that people don't buy into. Not that I whole-heartedly agree with strategy, but to advance technology there has to be some Brownian motion out there, and Google usually listens to the market, which is fine. In this case, however, there's really nothing innovative about visual bookmarks, and I can't see how the new system could harm market share or anything either. In fact, it could only help, since except the anti-design demographic, who would choose the aged and boring layout from the old system?<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-06-10-chrome-disappointment-the-shabby-and-boring-old-bookmark-system-from-stone-age-strikes-back.html#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Moreover, people tend to ignore the fact that the new system is also functionally superior &#8212; it offers to</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn and suggest folder for a new bookmark (which is often accurate);</li>
<li>Create auto folders based on site or keyword;</li>
<li>Allow arbitrary text data to be stored with each entry (e.g., a page-specific non-sensitive access code);</li>
<li>One tap pop from assigned folder;</li>
</ul>
<p>and more. Those that resist everything new are simply blind. The team claim that they are listening to "thoughtful feedback"; well, can they tell "thoughtful feedback" from blind suspicion and denial about everything? And they do realize that feedback is heavily biased, as someone with positive experience (unless he is a hardcore fan) is unlikely to leave them a thank you message? I think it's pretty clear that the majority of users won't care either way<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-06-10-chrome-disappointment-the-shabby-and-boring-old-bookmark-system-from-stone-age-strikes-back.html#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>; the majority of the rest was happy with the change; and the rest, comprising only a diminishingly small percentage, is what kept us from having nice things.</p>
<p>Even if one agrees with nothing from the last paragraph, one has to realize that randomly dropping a big change this way is just irresponsible.<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-06-10-chrome-disappointment-the-shabby-and-boring-old-bookmark-system-from-stone-age-strikes-back.html#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> There were hurt feelings when the change was first introduced (not that I care about them), so don't change mind again three weeks later, hurting yet another camp. Whether it was a change for the good or the bad, admit it was done (admit you screwed up if you did) and focus on improving it.</p>
<p>End of rant, off to install the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bookmark-manager/gmlllbghnfkpflemihljekbapjopfjik">Bookmark Manager extension</a>.</p>

<p>WWDC is Apple's biggest event every year, and WWDC keynote always attracts tons of hype. Apple knows that. In the past years folks who can't (at work, in class, etc.) or don't want to watch the crappy live stream would follow the various WWDC liveblogs presented by tech sites like Gizmodo, TechCrunch, Ars Technica, etc. But this year the landscape has changed: Apple rolled its own card-based liveblog at <a href="http://www.apple.com/live/2015-june-event/">www.apple.com/live/2015-june-event</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-06-08-apple-turns-its-homepage-into-a-wwdc-liveblog.html#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Not only that; during the keynote, Apple redirected its homepage to the liveblog page, so it effectively turned its homepage into a liveblog:</p>

<p>Of course, you miss a few jokes and random shots of Tim or Craig from the official liveblog, but hey, who don't like that official feel?<a class="footnoteRef" href="http://zmwangx.github.io/blog/2015-06-08-apple-turns-its-homepage-into-a-wwdc-liveblog.html#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Here are a few screenshots of today's liveblog. Unfortunately I only know some entry level JS, so I wasn't able to capture the entire page, which uses dynamic DOM based on one's position in the page.</p>

<p>By the way, here are the full-page screenshots of <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/elcapitan-preview/">OS X 10.11 El Capitan</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/ios9-preview/">iOS 9</a> previews. <code>pageres</code> recently <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/pageres/issues/174">cannot render web fonts</a>, which is rather annoying, so I used <a href="https://github.com/mrcoles/full-page-screen-capture-chrome-extension">Full Page Screen Capture</a> to capture the shots. I then resized to 50% to reduce filesizes a bit.</p>

<p>Back in July I registered the domain <a href="http://zhimingwang.org">zhimingwang.org</a> and pointed this GitHub Pages-powered blog at it. Since then I have lost the HTTPS badge due to GitHub Pages not supporting HTTPS on custom domains (see <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/156">isaacs/github#156</a>).</p>
<p>There have been a lot of discussions on isaacs/github#156 (and stupid <a href="/blog/2016-01-18-me-too-comments-on-github.html">+1's</a> too). Among the proposed solutions is putting the website behind CloudFlare. I carefully investigated <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/">this option</a> and read almost all the arguments against it. I fully understand CloudFlare's SSL models (summarized in the image below), and I do realize most if not all of the limitations of CloudFlare, including CloudFlare being a huge MITM (which is inevitable for a CDN anyway), as well as most if not all of its annoyances, including CAPTCHAs which I myself would occasionally run into when I'm browsing with PIA VPN, and JavaScript-based browser checks.</p>

<p>After careful evaluation, I decided that CloudFlare's SSL model is good enough for me. After all, this is just a damn blog, with nothing sensitive. TLS is still nice because it guards against prying eyes and unethical ad-injecting ISPs or Wi-Fi hotspots, but other than that, it isn't necessary.</p>
<p>End result: this blog is now behind CloudFlare. Readers should now see that green HTTPS badge again (note that I'm enforcing HTTPS — without HSTS though). As for CAPTCHAs, I have adjusted the firewall settings on CloudFlare's dashboard — "Security Level" to "Essentially Off" and "Challenge Passage" to 1 year, so hopefully it won't be too annoying.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>09/01/2016 Update.</strong> I just realized that <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/203306930-Does-CloudFlare-block-Tor-">CloudFlare supports whitelisting Tor traffic</a>. Did that.</p>

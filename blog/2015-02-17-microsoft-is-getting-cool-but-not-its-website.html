<p>Microsoft is getting kind of cool. For instance, open sourcing .NET last year caused quite a buzz. Ars has a good piece about this: <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/02/microsofts-continuing-efforts-to-be-cool/">Microsoftâ€™s continuing efforts to be cool</a>.</p>
<p>Three weeks ago Microsoft made another minor but totally unexpected move: they integrated AgileBits' <code>onepassword-app-extension</code> (<a href="https://github.com/AgileBits/onepassword-app-extension">GitHub</a>) into the 5.0 release of the OneDrive iOS app. I didn't realize this until I read <a href="https://blog.onedrive.com/onedrive_secure_password/">yesterday's blog post on the OneDrive Blog</a>. This is really amazing when you put it in context: I mean, take a look at <a href="https://blog.agilebits.com/1password-apps/">Apps that love 1Password</a>, i.e., apps that have integrated that extension. Out of the ninety apps listed to date, there are only a dozen apps that I've heard of, and the only brands bigger than 1Password are Microsoft, Tumblr, Uber (infamous), and Walmart (what?). Microsoft embracing third party is surely an interesting phenomenon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile,</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft still won't let us use our password managers to its fullest (of course we can't blame it on the OneDrive folks): 16 characters max in this day and age (screenshot taken today)? Hmm. And I remember Microsoft recently said password length isn't the main source of vulnerability of its customers. WTF. Who cares about <em>your</em> stupid customers. I just want to protect <em>my own</em> data, and make sure that in case of a breach on <em>your</em> side, I won't face the same loss as your technologically illiterate customers. But that's not currently possible with Microsoft.</li>
</ul>

<li>Microsoft's UI design is still shit, <a href="/blog/2015-01-21-web-design-microsoft-vs-apple.html">as well as their website</a>; I mean, seriously:</li>

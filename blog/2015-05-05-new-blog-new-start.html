<p>Octopress has been serving me for the past six months, during which even Octopress itself underwent major changes — in fact, <a href="https://github.com/octopress/octopress/releases/tag/v3.0.0">Octopress 3.0.0</a> was only released 3 days ago, which I never got to try. Anyway, Octopress's heavily colored interface grew old on me fairly quickly. I'm especially unhappy with the inline <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag, which is always wrapped in a white box and stands out too much (worse still, there's no visual difference when such a <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag is placed inside an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag). Since I use inline code/verbatim a lot, many of my articles were littered with arbitrary boxes everywhere.</p>

<p>Apparently I need something simpler. Because</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But how? Simiplicity 101: get rid of the &quot;platform&quot;. There's no reason why I need a blogging platform like Jekyll (let alone the WordPress monster). When I initially switched to Octopress, I thought code highlighting was something fancy that I need heavy machinery to achieve, but it turned out that Pandoc is battery-included when it comes to syntax highting,<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> so all I need is to specify a highlight style, e.g., Pygments:</p>
<pre><code>pandoc input.md --highlight-style=pygments --template template.html --output output.html</code></pre>
<p>That's it. Write the Markdown, compile with Pandoc, instantly awesome. So the HTML posts are there (assuming the HTML template is written, which is not hard to kick off).</p>
<p>The rest of the job is to design the stylesheets and compile the posts into a coherent blog — basically, generate an index. I was able to realize both in several hours. For the former task, I borrowed a lot from <a href="http://mort.ninja/">mort.ninja</a> by <a href="https://github.com/soimort">Mort Yao</a>. Interestingly, we were born in the same city (Nanjing, China), and I benefit from at least two of his open source projects: <a href="https://github.com/soimort/you-get">you-get</a> and <a href="https://github.com/soimort/translate-shell">translate-shell</a>. The latter task is more interesting but also not hard. I'm rolling my own toolchain in Python, which you can find in <a href="https://github.com/zmwangx/zmwangx.github.io/blob/source/pyblog"><code>pyblog</code></a>. In fact, the complete source of this blog (down to how image assets are generated) are in the <a href="https://github.com/zmwangx/zmwangx.github.io/tree/source"><code>source</code> branch</a> of my GitHub Pages repo, so you may take a look if you're interested. <code>pyblog</code> is highly specialized<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and is still a work in progress at the time of writing, but it's already well capable of generating the blog — currently missing are auto gen-deploy and preview (with auto-update), which will also come soon.</p>
<p>By the way, the most annoying thing in the development process was working with XML and generating <a href="/atom.xml">the Atom feed</a>. Standard library <code>xml.etree.ElementTree</code> doesn't support the <code>![CDATA[</code> tag, and in the end I had to hack <a href="https://github.com/zmwangx/zmwangx.github.io/blob/source/pyblog#L34-L54">library internals</a>, which is likely to break in future versions. Remember the quotes?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>XML is a classic political compromise: it balances the needs of man and machine by being equally unreadable to both.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>XML combines the efficiency of text files with the readability of binary files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sigh.</p>
<p>Anyway, here is my new shiny blog.</p>

<p>It looks ten times better than Octopress, and ever builds much faster than Octopress<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. As a bonus, the codebase is so small that it's super trivial to hack (no, not <em>that</em> hack).</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Well, Pandoc is heavy-machinery, but it's both generic and self-contained, unlike a specialized blogging platform.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Which is fine since I don't expect anyone else to use it, anyway.<a href="#fnref2">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>I have the impression that a complete build of all posts (about fifty of them) with <code>pyblog</code> is faster than regenerating for a single modified post in Octopress. That's in the context of absolutely no categories; when you have a dozen or more categories, Octopress slows down to a halt.<a href="#fnref3">↩</a></p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Of course you are always welcome to use the <a href="https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/">Google APIs Client Library for Python</a> to wrestle with YouTube, which is usually pretty simple. (As an added bonus, YouTube has some <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/code_samples/">nice runnable sample scripts</a> to get you started.) With the client library, listing videos in a YouTube playlist is a breeze.</p>

<p>However, if you don&rsquo;t feel like writing code yourself (I usually don&rsquo;t feel like writing code myself until I use something often enough and existing solutions are suboptimal), <code>youtube-dl</code> recently added the functionality to list videos in a playlist with the <code>--flat-playlist</code> option.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/issues/4003#issuecomment-60322630">According to one of the project collaborators</a>, currently <code>--flat-playlist</code> is only helpful with the <code>-j</code> option for dumping JSON (so I suppose this feature is subject to change). For instance, <code>--flat-playlist</code> alone would emit something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>which doesn&rsquo;t really make sense — it tells you that it collected 119 video ids, and no more. Once you have <code>-j</code> on, you get JSON data that you can parse with anything:</p>

<p>The most straightforward way to parse this is to use a command line JSON parser, the best one being <a href="https://github.com/stedolan/jq">jq</a>:</p>

<p>There you go, a list of URIs you can use. Of course you can put this in a script to save some typing:</p>

<p><strong><em>Aside:</em></strong> I first embedded the gist here, but <a href="http://i.imgur.com/m3cr0Im.png">it looked a bit off</a>. See <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/issues/1392">imathis/octopress#1392</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>In the next version of the Gist tag plugin we are just downloading the gists and embedding them upon generation so we don&rsquo;t have to worry about GitHub going down and breaking all your gists, or changing the HTML and breaking all the styles.</p>

<p>For the time being I suggest embedding your code snippets directly if you want them to look good.</p></blockquote>

<p>Okay. End of aside.</p>

<p>By the way, <code>youtube-dl</code> supports playlist bulk download natively. The reason I need a list of video ids or URIs, however, is that among other things, <code>youtube-dl</code> doesn&rsquo;t download highest resolution DASH video by default, so I have to rely on something like <code>youtube-dl-dash</code> (<a href="https://github.com/zmwangx/sh/blob/master/youtube-dl-dash">link</a>) to download the best version.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few days ago, I was cloning my entire Audio CD and DVD collection, and reported some of the findings in <a href="/blog/2014/10/26/audio-cd-slash-dvd-to-iso-image-on-os-x/">this post</a>. As said, the most important commands are</p>

<pre><code>hdiutil makehybrid -iso -joliet -o AUDIO_CD_NAME.iso SOURCE
</code></pre>

<p>for Audio CDs and</p>

<pre><code>hdiutil makehybrid -udf -o DVD_NAME.iso SOURCE
</code></pre>

<p>for DVDs.</p>

<p>Those alone don&rsquo;t finish the story. I also tried other things and unfortunately encountered problems. I was too busy to report back then, but now I&rsquo;ll summarize some of the findings.</p>

<hr />

<p>For one thing, <code>hdiutil makehybrid</code> might fail, issuing an &ldquo;Operation not permitted&rdquo; for no obvious reason. This could even happen when you work with the Disk Utility GUI (for which I once got a &ldquo;Permission denied&rdquo;). Even <code>sudo</code> didn&rsquo;t help in my case. However, I was able to <strong>circumvent the problem with the root shell</strong> (I won&rsquo;t tell you how to enter the root shell — you need to at least have that amount of knowledge about the root shell before you are given the key). Not sure why. Just keep in mind that the root shell might help (that&rsquo;s also a general, albeit dangerous, advice for life).</p>

<hr />

<p>Next onto grabbing the raw VOB.</p>

<p><code>vobcopy</code> is pretty sweet, but at least for me it had one huge problem. When I tried to copy a single title, say title #2 with</p>

<pre><code>vobcopy --title-number TITLE_NUMBER -i SOURCE
</code></pre>

<p>other titles got copied, too. I didn&rsquo;t have enough samples to test out, but presumably it&rsquo;s because the problematic DVD has a structure like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HTgmwQL.png" alt="problematic DVD title structure" /></p>

<p>Anyway, no matter I <code>vobcopy</code> title 01, 02, or 03, the result was the same — the whole thing. That&rsquo;s pretty stupid. I don&rsquo;t know if it counts as a bug or unfinished feature. Definitely not cool.</p>

<p>(One cool thing about <code>vobcopy</code>: as long as you complied with <code>libdvdread</code>, you can create a fully decrypted version of the DVD with</p>

<pre><code>vobcopy --mirror -i SOURCE
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, to get an iso image out of the decrypted mirror, you run the <code>hdiutil makehybrid -udf</code> command given above.)</p>

<hr />

<p>So <code>vobcopy</code> is dead (for copying specific titles in unfortunate DVDs). What&rsquo;s next?</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s <code>dvdbackup</code>. The man page is good, and <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/dvdbackup#A_single_title">ArchWiki</a> is even better (<em>ArchWiki is awesome!</em>), providing you cookbook solutions of combining the power of <code>dvdbackup</code> and <code>dvdauthor</code> (cookbooks are nice when dealing with unexciting technologies like DVD). In fact, <code>dvdbackup</code> alone is enough for extracting the VOBs of relatively small titles (&lt; 1GiB):</p>

<pre><code>dvdbackup -i SOURCE -o VOB_TARGET_DIR -t TITLE_NUMBER -n TITLE_NAME
</code></pre>

<p>then grab your title-specific VOB in <code>VOB_TARGET_DIR/TITLE_NAME/VIDEO_TS</code>. Unlike <code>vobcopy</code>&rsquo;s <code>-n/--title-number</code> option, <code>dvdbackup</code>&rsquo;s <code>-t/--title</code> option does it right, trimming everything else. However, there&rsquo;s a problem when the title is larger than 1 GiB — then <code>dvdbackup</code> will split the VOB into several 1 GiB max pieces, and there&rsquo;s no way to disable this (since <code>dvdbackup</code> is targeting a DVD player — ancient technology — rather than <code>mpv</code> or whatever). What&rsquo;s sadder is that I can&rsquo;t seem to combine the split VOBs with FFmpeg stream copy — <code>pcm_dvd</code> audio always gets converted to <code>mp2</code> and fails when I use <code>-c copy</code>. I&rsquo;m not a codec expert, but I suppose this is due to the fact that <code>pcm_dvd</code> isn&rsquo;t a supported encoding codec of FFmpeg (at least not my FFmpeg):</p>

<pre><code>&gt; ffmpeg -codecs | grep pcm_dvd
D.A..S pcm_dvd              PCM signed 20|24-bit big-endian
</code></pre>

<p><code>D</code> is for &ldquo;Decoding supported&rdquo;, <code>A</code> is for &ldquo;Audio codec&rdquo;, <code>S</code> is for &ldquo;Lossless compression&rdquo; — no encoding support. By the way, my FFmpeg is <code>brew</code>ed with the options <code>--with-fdk-aac</code>, <code>--with-ffplay</code>, <code>--with-freetype</code>, <code>--with-libass</code>, <code>--with-libbluray</code>, <code>--with-openjpeg</code>, <code>--with-openssl</code>, <code>--with-x265</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; \ffmpeg -version

</code></pre>

<p>Maybe I missed some <code>--enable</code>.</p>

<p>Sorry for the digression. So, it&rsquo;s not possible to stream-copy-concat the VOBs with FFmpeg. (In fact, since audio quality is not that important — you won&rsquo;t be able to tell 256k AAC from lossless anyway, especially when you are focusing on the video, so you can always transcode <code>pcm_dvd</code> into 256k AAC with <code>-c:a libfdk_aac -b:a 256k</code>. <code>mpeg2video</code> is an encoding supported codec so stream copy works fine. Or you may also use <code>flac</code> or whatever encoding-supported lossless codec.) However, if you insist on getting the original <code>pcm_dvd</code>, there is a way, an ugly way. You&rsquo;ve gotta be creative here. <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/dvdbackup#A_single_title">ArchWiki</a> already provides a cookbook solution on how to use <code>dvdbackup</code> and <code>dvdauthor</code> to create a DVD with a selected title. And <code>vobcopy</code> can copy the entire thing just fine, without the 1 GiB limit (make sure to use the <code>-l/--large-file</code> option if the size is greater than 2 GiB). Therefore, you can create a DVD with selected title from the original DVD, then <code>vobcopy</code> from the new DVD. This is insane, but it works, I&rsquo;ve tested that. <strong>Note, however, that timestamps might be wrong with <code>vobcopy</code>, so the VOB runs just fine linearly but might run into problems when you seek.</strong> Therefore, FFmpeg is still the way to go. Or maybe you can do it right with one click using some closed source software ☹ — I&rsquo;ve heard about success stories with the long ceased DVD Decrypter Windows project. In reality, I guess only people with theoretical interest or OCD will ever do this — FLAC or AAC should serve everyone just fine. It should have worked with <code>vobcopy</code> alone, but it doesn&rsquo;t. Hence the workaround.</p>

<hr />

<p>For future reference, I&rsquo;ll translate the ArchWiki cookbook solution here (it&rsquo;s too cookbook itself, specifying paths like <code>~/movie_name</code> and using unnecessary <code>cd</code>) about creating a title-specific DVD from a multi-title DVD (replace <code>SOURCE</code>, <code>VOB_TARGET_DIR</code>, <code>DVD_TARGET_DIR</code>, <code>TITLE_NUMBER</code>, and <code>TITLE_NAME</code> with sane values):</p>

<pre><code>dvdbackup -i SOURCE -o VOB_TARGET_DIR -t TITLE_NUMBER -n TITLE_NAME
dvdauthor -t -o DVD_TARGET_DIR VOB_TARGET_DIR/TITLE_NAME/VIDEO_TS/*.VOB
export VIDEO_FORMAT=NTSC
cd DVD_TARGET_DIR/VIDEO_TS &amp;&amp; dvdauthor -T -o DVD_TARGET_DIR
</code></pre>

<p><code>export VIDEO_FORMAT=NTSC</code> is to avoid the <code>dvdauthor</code> error of &ldquo;no default video format, must explicitly specify NTSC or PAL&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m not sure about the difference between NTSC and PAL, but I saw NTSC printed on my DVD, so I used it). And there you go, a shiny new DVD filesystem located in <code>DVD_TARGET_DIR</code>. (Note that unlike <code>vobcopy</code>, <code>dvdbackup</code> doesn&rsquo;t feature a nice progress bar even when <code>-v/--verbose</code> and <code>-p/--progress</code> are specified.) Then you can</p>

<pre><code>vobcopy -l DVD_TARGET_DIR
</code></pre>

<p>if you&rsquo;d like to. Recall that timestamps might be wrong, sadly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Up to this point I&rsquo;ve been using Google Drive as an online backup service, and uploads files mostly manually, although I do sync <code>~/img</code> with the client.</p>

<p><strong>Aside.</strong> Google Drive, OneDrive, etc. don&rsquo;t work with symlinks. Wanna keep your stuff free and duplicate-free yet still synced to the servers? Use <code>rsync</code> to automatically reproduce your folder structure with hard links:</p>

<pre><code>rsync -avzP --delete --link-dest=SOURCE/ SOURCE DESTINATION
</code></pre>

<p>e.g.,</p>

<pre><code>rsync -avzP --delete --link-dest=~/img/ ~/img/ ~/sync/GoogleDrive/img/
</code></pre>

<p>automatically reproduces my <code>~/img</code> in the <code>img</code> directory under Google Drive&rsquo;s root, yet every file in the <code>~/img</code> tree is replaced by hard links to the original file, so the new structure within Google Drive takes little additional space — for the directories only.</p>

<p>That doesn&rsquo;t solve every problem though, as you will see shortly. <em>End of aside.</em></p>

<p>So, up to this point I’ve mostly used Google Drive as an online backup service by manually uploading (huge) stuff. But at some point I’m gonna automate parts of the uploading. As it turns out, I can keep some smaller video files on my hard drive; other bigger monsters (like movies, TV shows, etc., especially a lot of 1080i Transport Streams directly from TV broadcasts) are uploaded and then moved to external drives. Some of the smaller files, including things downloaded from YouTube, live in <code>~/vid/etc</code>, and I want to sync this folder to Google Drive. What&rsquo;s shocking is that this is not possible with the Google Drive client — it only allows selective syncing of the top level folders. Let me repeat this:</p>

<p><strong>The Google Drive client only allows selective syncing of the <em>top level folders</em>.</strong></p>

<p>This is <em>insane</em>. It’s almost 2015. Everyone supports this — Dropbox, Microsoft, Box, even Baidu. Google Drive launched on April 24, 2012, that’s 2.5 years ago. <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/drive/Gs2w1BL-B9U">This thread</a> on Google Drive Forum, “Ability to sync only selected sub folders”, was posted on August 27, 2012, and has garnered 139 replies. They are ignored by the developers, and the accepted “answer” is to utilize Google Drive’s assign-one-file/folder-to-multiple-folders feature to create a special “sync” directory. Okay, that’s a stupid hard link solution on the server side. Okay, if that works… <em>No</em>. “Hard links on the server side” cannot bear different names; so what if I want to sync, say, both <code>vid/etc</code> and <code>aud/etc</code>? Whoops. So I also have to do all sorts of ugly renaming. NO, GOOGLE, NO, I won&rsquo;t accept that much trouble.</p>

<p>This kind of insanity makes me wander:</p>

<p><strong>Do the Google Drive developers use Google Drive themselves?</strong></p>

<p>For now I&rsquo;m moving <code>vid/etc</code> to <code>vid_etc</code>. Sigh.</p>

<hr />

<p>There are other problems that I encountered with Google Drive sync today. For one thing, it rejects what I already have and insists on starting from scratch. I mean, say I have uploaded a folder via the web interface, and later wants to keep it in sync (of course that&rsquo;s only possible if it&rsquo;s top level), so I put what I already have there. Nope, Google Drive reports that as a conflict and insists on downloading all the stuff again. Apart from wasted traffic, that also ruins my hard links, so I have to either wipe everything clean on the server side and reupload, or redownload everything and redo all the hard-linking after the download finishes. Either way, very annoying. I opted for the first one. (I later empirically confirmed that OneDrive could handle this situation.)</p>

<p>There are other problems that don&rsquo;t pop right off my mind. Anyway, the gist is,</p>

<p><strong>Google Drive is not yet sync-ready for power users (maybe even laymen).</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>Then, is OneDrive perfect? No. I know it recently went unlimited, but there’s one major annoyance: the speed. Stanford’s Ethernet speed is almost 1 Gbps UL/DL, but the OneDrive client tops out at about 2 MBps. The web interface isn’t much better. Google Drive is a lot faster than that, which makes it a good backup service for manual uploading. Anyway, maybe OneDrive will improve over time; yesterday they delivered an update to OneDrive.app, and at least it finally works.</p>

<p>OneDrive also boasts no file status indicators on OS X, which everyone else in the industry has. That’s not a show-stopper though, if you just use it as a backup service.</p>

<hr />

<p>What about Dropbox? Dropbox is a truly awesome sync-ready service, but it is at the same time pretty expensive compared to others. Also, since I use Dropbox as a sync service, it must be up at all times and constantly indexing, so I’m really cautious with what I put there to avoid unnecessary cycles and startup time.</p>

<hr />

<p>Everything is broken in one way or another. Sigh. Let&rsquo;s hope that OneDrive improves a lot in the coming months; if it&rsquo;s stable enough and the speed gets some boost, I&rsquo;ll cancel my Google Drive subscription. I am a Google supporter and Microsoft hater, but a service that <em>works</em> is more important than ideology.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>10/28/2014 Update:</strong></p>

<p>Yesterday Microsoft pushed an update to OneDrive.app to MAS. After uninstalling, reinstalling, and wiping the 10 GB folder I&rsquo;d like to sync (that&rsquo;s for photos; I upload videos via the web interface) on both client and server sides, it actually began to work. The speed was around 1 MB/s during my last sync of 10 GB worth of data. Not fast, but I will be fairly satisfied if it can keep up with that speed. Time will tell.</p>

<hr />

<p>The OneDrive team just <a href="https://blog.onedrive.com/office-365-onedrive-unlimited-storage/">announced on their blog</a> that</p>

<blockquote><p>Today, storage limits just became a thing of the past with Office 365. Moving forward, all Office 365 customers will get unlimited OneDrive storage at no additional cost.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hell, I hate Microsoft, but <strong>I have to say that this is big</strong>. OneDrive might not be the first to offer unlimited cloud storage (not sure), but it is certainly the first one to roll it out on such a grand scale. Remember, Office 365 is just $99.99 a year. OneDrive might not be the best cloud storage service, especially for OS X customers, but unlimited is unlimited — in comparison, I pay Google $9.99 a month for 1 TB.</p>

<p>Microsoft products are indeed pure crap on a Mac. Office for Mac 2011 is horrible (speed and bloat aside, some features are simply not implemented — try to import a UTF-8 CSV into Excel, all non-ASCII characters become underscores; Microsoft’s response was that Unicode import was not implemented yet). OneDrive.app is slow like crawl, and it never finishes syncing — always stuck on the last few megabytes, eating up 100% CPU. Thank god I only use it for backups. The web interface is okay, although Google Drive is faster — blazing fast, I can easily upload with 20+MB/s. But again, <strong>unlimited is unlimited.</strong></p>

<p>Microsoft is opening a new chapter of cloud storage. In today’s world, we have so many huge video files, so storage limit should indeed be something of the past. This is a smart move for Microsoft — when you have, say, 100 TB up there (which seems very far at this moment, but what if all contents go 4K), and if competitors don’t offer comparable plans, then you are stuck with Microsoft. And Office. Oh my god, Microsoft Office must die.</p>

<p>Of course I don’t want to be stuck with Microsoft, so I’m looking at how Google and Apple will handle this. Google ought to offer more affordable plans, preferably also unlimited. (My 1Password still has it that I purchased Office for Mac University 2011 on Nov 12, 2012 for $99.99. That turned into a free 4-year Office 365 subscription, which contains 60 world minutes of Skype per month, 1 TB of OneDrive — oh, now it’s about to go unlimited. All for $99.99. In comparison, Google charges me $119.88 per year.) Apple wants you to save everything to iCloud, and it introduced iCloud Drive and Cloud Kit this year — but plans still start at 5 GB and tops out at 1 TB, seriously? Dude, you sell top notch hardware with huge profits; why don’t you pay your customers back by offering better cloud storage — that’s also better for iCloud.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong><em>11/02/2014 update:</em></strong></p>

<p>See <a href="/blog/2014/11/02/vobcopy-dvdbackup-etc/">this post</a> for issues, explanations, and more.</p>

<hr />

<p>Today it occurred to me that I should make clones of my audio CDs (as stand-alone ISO images, I mean, not just rsyncing the AIFFs to subdirectories in <code>~/aud/lossless</code>). One can never have too many backups.</p>

<p>Of course I could simply pack the aforementioned directories with AIFFs into ISOs — that’s not impressive. The end result might actually be the same, but I want to make the clones directly from the original CDs. It turns out that this is not so simple with the Disk Utility GUI — unlike DVDs, the “New Image” option is grayed out for Audio CDs. I’m not sure why, but maybe they want you to just use iTunes to deal with Audio CDs (which works well for all practical purposes — but theoretical curiosity never ends).</p>

<p>So there comes <code>hdiutil</code>. <code>hdiutil</code> and <code>diskutil</code> are the utilities underlying Disk Utility. Unfortunately, so far I know little about them except for simplest things like <code>diskutil list</code>, <code>diskutil mount</code>, <code>hdiutil attach -stdinpass</code>, etc. (I&rsquo;m so ignorant about anything filesystem related!) The <code>hdiutil</code> verb that makes cross-platform CD or DVD is <code>makehybrid</code>, which supports the following filesystem options: <code>-hfs</code> (holy crap, no HFS+ please! Apple ought to replace this thirty-year-old filesystem — ZFS or something better please!), <code>-iso</code>, <code>-joliet</code>, and <code>-udf</code>. For Audio CDs you use <code>-iso</code> and with <code>-joliet</code> extension:</p>

<pre><code>hdiutil makehybrid -iso -joliet -o AUDIO_CD_NAME.iso SOURCE
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>SOURCE</code> can be the mount point, the disk device file, etc. Similarly, although you can create <code>.cdr</code> images from DVDs via the Disk Utility GUI, you can also do it with <code>hdiutil</code> (which is potentially more portable — I’ve never heard a definitive answer of whether renaming <code>.cdr</code> to <code>.iso</code> really cross-platform):</p>

<pre><code>hdiutil makehybrid -udf -o DVD_NAME.iso SOURCE
</code></pre>

<p>This way CSS keys <em>seem</em> to be cloned as well, since I was able to authenticate such a CSS-protected DVD with <code>libdvdread</code>.</p>

<hr />

<p>P.S. I sincerely hope that one day lossless music tracks are no longer distributed through CD-ROMs. So painful — even my Internet speed is more than ten times faster than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-ROM#Transfer_rates">highest transfer rate</a> available from any CD-ROM. (I’ve heard about some websites distributing lossless music digitally, but that won’t happen to the music I care about in the near future.) I still like physical albums though — a real sense of possession. Maybe they should contain the physical goodies and some sort of access codes?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>DaisyDisk is a pretty famous name. I’ve heard a lot that DaisyDisk is beautiful, but as a “power user” I always feel ashamed about using a disk analyzer or visualizer (although no one really cares). I’m pretty comfortable with doing most filesystem operations right in the shell, and for other tasks too tedious for the shell (like renaming a bunch of files with no obvious pattern), Finder (equipped with TotalFinder) works just fine.</p>

<p>Today I was trying clean up my drive a bit, as there were only 22GB left. I knew where the main problem lied: a huge number of highres videos lying in <code>~/vid/staging</code>, awaiting renaming and migration to my external drive. Anyway, it would be nice to have some visualization of a detailed breakdown of my disk usage, preferably on any level I want without multiple passes of <code>du</code>. The name DaisyDisk popped up from the cache in my brain, so I headed over to their website to download it.</p>

<p>The result is not disappointing at all. Look at this:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vyIwSNQ.png" alt="DaisyDisk screen shot" /></p>

<p>Beautiful. Moreover, functional. It indeed gives me a detailed breakdown on any level, within any directory (given enough priviledge). I can also collect items I don’t want and let DaisyDisk clean up for me at once (not surprising for a disk analyzer); this feature isn’t that useful for me since I know exactly where my queues of unorganized items are — <code>~/Downloads</code>, <code>~/aud/staging</code>, <code>~/img/staging</code>, and <code>~/vid/staging</code>.</p>

<p>By the way, DaisyDisk seems to be WinRAR-free. (Rest assured; I’m a good guy and I <em>will</em> purchase a license — these days whether to purchase the website or the MAS version is a headache, though.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just learned something new. Whenever you install a <code>pkg</code> on OS X, OS X stores a receipt of what was installed in <code>/var/db/receipts</code> (I&rsquo;m running OS X 10.9.5 at the time of writing), called a <strong>bom</strong> — bill of materials (I’d rather call it a manifest, whatever). This feature was introduced in NeXTSTEP. From <code>man 5 bom</code>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Mac OS X Installer uses a file system &ldquo;bill of materials&rdquo; to determine which files to install, remove, or upgrade. A bill of materials, <strong>bom</strong>, contains all the files within a directory, along with some information about each file. File information includes: the file&rsquo;s UNIX permissions, its owner and group, its size, its time of last modification, and so on.  Also included are a checksum of each file and information about hard links.</p></blockquote>

<p><code>man 5 bom</code> is actually badly maintained, as it says &ldquo;The bill of materials for installed packages are found within the package receipts located in /Library/Receipts,&rdquo; whereas those have been migrated to <code>/var/db/receipts</code> a long time ago.</p>

<p><code>.bom</code> files are binary, but you can access the contents via <code>lsbom</code>. For instance, to list the files installed,</p>

<pre><code>lsbom -f /var/db/receipts/org.macports.MacPorts.bom
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the paths printed are always relative to <code>/</code>. See <code>man 1 lsbom</code> for detailed option listing.</p>

<p>(Beware when you try to clean up unwanted packages using the <code>lsbom</code> listing. Packages might overwrite files, so make sure you review the listing first and know what you are doing. &ldquo;Knowing what you are doing&rdquo; is the prerequisite for using <code>sudo</code> anyway.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today&rsquo;s news has it that Charles Munger made a $65 million donation to KITP at UCSB. See for instance <a href="http://nyti.ms/1D4zg24">this article</a> on NYT. Of course I didn&rsquo;t learn it from NYT (I&rsquo;m generally sick of any news other than math, physics, or IT-related ones). I learned it from <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=7247">Not Even Wrong</a> instead (of course I don&rsquo;t agree with Woit, but some of his links are nice).</p>

<p>I have no interest whatsoever in the business world, so I have no idea about Warren Buffett&rsquo;s business partners (although I&rsquo;m still worldly enough to know Warren Buffett). However, the name Charles Munger sounded surprisingly familiar. After reading the sentence</p>

<blockquote><p>Mr. Munger has frequently donated big sums to schools like Stanford and the Harvard-Westlake School.</p></blockquote>

<p>from the NYT article linked above, it finally hit me that Mr. Munger is the donor of the Munger Graduate Residence here at Stanford. Munger is really nice, much better than our undergrad residences AFAIK (location-wise Roble is still unbeatable for mathematicians and physicists, although Munger still kicks EV&rsquo;s ass).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad to see more and more entrepreneurs funding physics, especially theoretical physics, whether they understand it or not. (<strong>Aside:</strong> Even for laypeople theoretical physics is cool isn&rsquo;t it, like the coolest kid in class. I won&rsquo;t comment on whether math is cooler, but breakthrough mathematical work certainly go largely unnoticed in the public, since theoretical physics is the last thing that laypeople can &ldquo;vaguely understand&rdquo;. Do some name searches on Google to see how math and physics play out in the limelight — hint:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gauss — 4,130,000 results;</li>
<li>Euler — 855,000 results;</li>
<li>Newton — 13,200,000 results;</li>
<li>Einstein — 6,330,000 results.</li>
</ul>


<p>End of aside.) Engaging in physics is plain better than engaging in some questionable philanthropy. (Have you heard that Gates Foundation invested in G4S, the largest private military and security company in the world? I’m not sure about the details — I once read that off a bathroom flyer — but that’s definitely interesting philanthropy.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I upgraded the RAM of my MacBook Pro mid-2012 to 2x8GB. I purchased the <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B008LTBJFW">Crucial 16GB Kit (8GBx2) DDR3/DDR3L 1600 MHz (PC3-12800) CL11 SODIMM 204-Pin 1.35V/1.5V Memory for Mac CT2K8G3S160BM</a> from Amazon, which cose me $146.64 after tax. I followed the <a href="http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201165">official guide</a> as well as the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+13-Inch+Unibody+Mid+2012+RAM+Replacement/10374">iFixit guide</a>. To finish the job I needed a Phillips #00 screwdriver and a spudger, so I purchased the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Tools/Spudger/IF145-002">spudger</a> and the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Tools/54-Bit-Driver-Kit/IF145-022-1">54 bit driver kit</a> from iFixit.</p>

<p>The actual process was pretty simple. I had a little bit of hard time pulling out the bottom module and pushing in the top module, but overall it was smooth. The only stupid thing I did was that I forgot to push the battery connector back in before I closed the case; I only realized this when I was screwing in the eighth screw (that was a close one!), and had to unscrew everything again.</p>

<p>After I replaced the RAM modules, booting was just normal. And now I&rsquo;ve got 16 gigs of RAM!</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/PGhdEGr.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Want to run multiple memory hoggers <em>along with a Windows VM</em> (with 4GB of RAM)? No problem.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/czDcVaK.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>By the way, Yosemite is indeed really aggressive at RAM usage. I reserve my opinion on whether there&rsquo;s a memory leak. But so far the performance has been fine, even with 8GB of RAM.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I wrote an expository article, <a href="/pdf/20141119-convolution-of-irreducible-characters.pdf"><em>Convolution of irreducible characters</em></a>, and posted it <a href="/blog/2014/11/19/convolution-of-irreducible-characters/">here</a>. At first I intended to use MathJax, but in the end I fell back to good ol&#8217; PDF. Here&rsquo;s why.</p>

<p>In short, I&rsquo;m a mathematician. I write math <em>articles</em>, not just standalone expressions or formulas. I use AMSLaTeX to its fullest (not really, but at least I use numbering and the <code>amsthm</code> package to its fullest). HTML simply wasn&rsquo;t designed for this. Here are two influential markup languages designed for totally different use cases, and bridging them is painful. I tried to use <code>pandoc</code>, but it doesn&rsquo;t support <code>\input</code>, doesn&rsquo;t support <code>\def</code>, and swallows <code>\begin{theorem} \end{theorem}</code>, among other things. I tried to use <code>htlatex</code>; even the MathML output is suboptimal, with many math symbols translated to non-math (apart from totally human-unreadable), and it uses its custom CSS files that don&rsquo;t play well with everything else. I tried other things. In the end I gave up. Maybe I don&rsquo;t know enough about MathJax, but I certainly don&rsquo;t want to write a translator myself. Leave LaTeX alone. Distribute as PDF. MathJax may be great for Wikis (like Wikipedia) and for math lite blogs, but it&rsquo;s no replacement for real, beefy LaTeX. It&rsquo;s not for mathematicians who want to distribute real articles.</p>

<p>By the way, Terry Tao and others use <a href="http://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/latex-to-wordpress/">Luca&rsquo;s LaTeX to WordPress, aka LaTeX2WP</a> for math blogging. From Terry&rsquo;s experience it works fairly well. I don&rsquo;t know if <code>amsthm</code> and <code>\def</code> are in the feature set, though. Anyway, since WordPress handles LaTeX as pre-compiled images (which is also the default on Wikipedia, and which looks poor in general and plays horribly with scaling), LaTeX2WP won&rsquo;t help MathJax users the slightest.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>TL; DR:</strong> Jump to the paragraph “In the end…”</p>

<hr />

<p>I&rsquo;m not a photo-savvy guy. I&rsquo;ve never taken a single selfie in my life, and my iPhone Photos app witnesses about twenty photos a year — fifteen of which are accidental screenshots. Okay, a little bit of exaggeration. The iPhone, aka iCamera, especially the 6 Plus model, is sort of a waste in my possession. However, my grandparents came to visit me on campus yesterday, and my grandma <em>loves</em> photos. So I took one with them, using my phone (which is obviously better than my grandma’s digital camera). The lighting was wrong, but I was able to fix that in five seconds — clicked “Edit”, clicked on the little sun icon (whatever it is called), clicked on “Light”, slided the slidebar all the way to the right, and all of a sudden it looked perfect. (This is the first time I ever clicked those, but I got it nicely done in five seconds — very intuitive, deeply impressed.) From a layman’s perspective, the builtin edit feature of the Photos app is really smart. Later I tried to reproduce the same edit with iPhoto, but I had to manually wrestle with exposure, highlights, shadows, brightness, contrast, etc., and I just never got it right. Call me a moron if you feel like it, but I’ve already given you the context at the beginning of this article, so you can’t blame me. (For your reference, I do ’shop some images for fun and profit from time to time, but I never deal with actual unedited photos, so I never have to worry about exposure and stuff.)</p>

<p>So far so good. The frustation began when I try to import the photo to my Mac. I’m certainly not a mobile guy who keeps everything on his phone or the cloud. I have the photo import feature of Dropbox turned on, so as I plugged in my phone the photo already appearred in the Camera Upload folder. Wait what, two copies? Two copies that looked exactly the same, albeit one is about 0.1 MB larger than the other? Not cool. Pulled up Image Capture; Apple’s own software should do the trick, I guess. Nope, same thing. Googled, found this article on support.apple.com: <a href="http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203612"><em>iOS: Edited photos show original photo after import or in other apps</em></a>. Okay sure, they know this. Let&rsquo;s listen to what they have to say.</p>

<blockquote><p>Apple uses Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP), a standard created by Adobe, for nondestructive photo editing. XMP allows you to undo edits and to revert back to an original photo without the loss of quality. Displaying the edited photo requires OS X v10.9 or later and software that can read XMP. The following applications support XMP:</p>

<ul>
<li>iPhoto 9.5 or later</li>
<li>iPhoto for iOS</li>
<li>Aperture 3 or later</li>
<li>Adobe Lightroom</li>
<li>Adobe Photoshop Elements</li>
</ul>


<p>Other photo-management applications and some iOS apps may also display XMP.</p></blockquote>

<p>Adobe Lightroom, oh well. I don’t yet have Adobe CC installed — Photoshop is certainly a powerhouse (plus Illustrator, InDesign, etc. are nice to have at times), but Pixelmator works fine for me most of the time, and I’m happy to go to a library iMac or Mac Pro when I do need the power; $29.99/$19.99 is just too much if I use it twice a month. I theorize that I can indefinitely extend the free trial by running CC in a VM, reverting to a clean snapshot and regenerating the MAC address from time to time, but that’s only a theory — I haven’t got the incentive to test it out. As for iPhoto, I know it’s pretty lame from past experience, and I was very much baffled by the ugly and unintuitive UI, so normally I don’t even want to waste disk space on it; but since it’s only official solution other than expensive Adobe products and Aperture, I decided to install it. 1.7 GB gone. <em>So does the wasted 1.7 GB do the trick? Sadly, no.</em> Still the same thing in iPhoto 9.6, which is clearly “iPhoto 9.5 or later”. Totally baffled.</p>

<p>In the end, I came up with an ugly solution. Just email or iMessage the photo to yourself from the phone. If you use email though, be sure to use the builtin Mail, or you would likely lose Exif data (I sent from Mailbox and lost Exif; I then sent from Mail and didn’t). This is really annoying since setting up accounts in the builtin Mail app is not fun — Google 2FA is not supported, and I have to generate an app-specific password. Compare to Mailbox, where <em>I signed into Dropbox on the new phone and within five seconds all of my ten email accounts are ready to use</em>. The loss of Exif data is probably related to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20763814">this thread on SO</a>, but I didn’t delve into it since I’m not a Cocoa Touch dev. What’s more confusing, sending the photo via different applications result in different filesizes. The one sent from Mail (I chose original size when I sent it) was a 2 MB JPEG; the one sent from Mailbox was a 4.5 MB JPEG (without the right Exif); and the one sent via iMessage and later opened from the Messages app on Yosemite could be saved as a 10 MB lossless PNG (Exif was there). I went with the 2 MB one in the end.</p>

<p>I don’t know if iCloud Photo Library will solve the problem in the end. From my perspective, <em>Apple should train Preview and QuickLook to recognize their XMP technology.</em> Seriously, they talk about continuity, and I expect to enjoy my enhanced photos on my Mac without going through all the hessle and confusion. Photo enhancing is already such a breeze, thank you; now make sharing and archiving easy, at least within the Apple ecosystem. (Although I’m not familiar with photography and image editing in general, considering how tech-savvy I am, I bet most users can’t even figure out one annoying solution.)</p>

<p>By the way, Continuity and Handoff only work intermittently for me, and AirDrop between my iPhone (6 Plus) and MacBook Pro (mid-2012, model 9,2) doesn’t work at all. Continuity and Handoff sometimes turn up when they are unexpected (and serve as kinda nice surprises), but when I try to nail them, they remain elusive. Not a big deal for me, but certainly not the most pleasant thing ever. I bet these have to do with the fact that my Mac is connected to Ethernet and sharing the Ethernet connection to my iPhone; these days they expect everyone to be on Wi-Fi (and ironically they messed up big in Yosemite), but Wi-Fi simply can’t beat the speed and stability of Ethernet. I didn’t bother to test whether the features work when my devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi network; even if they do, that’s not my production setup, so they’re still useless to me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I propose the following cloud storage and syncing service model of the future. I call it <strong>Dropbot for Geeks®</strong>, and it totally rules. It&rsquo;s designed for geeks who are tired of the highly limited, miserably unproductive traditional services (based on clicking around). It has the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Standard Unix file system commands exposed as an API, e.g., <code>cat</code>, <code>cd</code>, <code>cp</code>, <code>du</code>, <code>df</code>, <code>file</code>, <code>find</code>, <code>head</code>, <code>ln</code>, <code>ls</code>, <code>mkdir</code>, <code>mv</code>, <code>pwd</code>, <code>rm</code>, <code>rmdir</code>, <code>tail</code>, <code>touch</code>, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>A rudimentary shell emulator through the web interface exposing the commands above.</p></li>
<li><p>Secure shell access to the file system, also exposing the commands above. Provide two-factor auth for SSH. Clearly, <code>scp</code> should also be supported.</p></li>
<li><p>Checksums. Expose, for instance, <code>md5sum</code> or <code>sha1sum</code>, in the API. Provide checksums on download pages, probably on demand.</p></li>
<li><p>Programmable selective syncing, down to per file level.</p></li>
<li><p>Scriptability. Allow clients to run custom scheduled jobs or daemons with the API above. To prevent the service from becoming full-featured IaaS, though, clients might be limited in CPU time, memory, or command selection. This bullet point is arguable.</p></li>
</ul>


<hr />

<p>With the level of command line integration illustrated above, we&rsquo;ll finally get rid of clicking around and not being able to automate chores. Navgating the remote file system will be a breeze — click, click, click, click, click (sometimes click should be replaced by double click, which is even more painful) just to navigate to a directory will be made a thing of the past. <code>ln</code>, in particular, saves disk space for duplicates — Dropbot for Geeks does <em>not</em> want to charge you extra for multiple copies of the same file in different directories. (To facilitate syncing hardlinks, clients should be able to specify hardlinked files in a config file. Or maybe some better mechanism. This might be hard.) At last, checksums are a must. I’ve had traumatic experiences like having downloaded an eight-part RAR, 1 GiB each, only to find that it wouldn’t unRAR. Without checksums, it was impossible to find which part was corrupted. As a result, I had to re-download everything — a nightmare. I never want to experience similar problems again. Hence the precious checksums.</p>

<p>Dropbot for Geeks looks like a pretty good (well, not really, but at least pretty cool®) model. Maybe I should patent it before anyone else? Then if some similar service surfaces in the future, I can <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/11/jury-apple-must-pay-23-6m-for-old-pager-patents/">sue their ass off and enjoy some hot cash</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong><em>TL; DR:</em> The actual PDF write-up is <a href="/pdf/20141119-convolution-of-irreducible-characters.pdf">here</a>.</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>Yesterday I was trying to establish the formula for orthogonal primitive central idempotents of a group ring. It is possible to establish the result through the convolution of irreducible characters. However, I stuck quite a while on trying to work out the convolutions themselves. For a formidable and unenlightening proof using &ldquo;matrix entry functions&rdquo; (i.e., fix a basis, induce a matrix representation, and explicitly expand everything in matrix elements), see <a href="http://drexel28.wordpress.com/2011/03/02/representation-theory-using-orthogonality-relations-to-compute-convolutions-of-characters-and-matrix-entry-functions/">this post</a> (in fact, this is just one in a series of posts that lead up to the result). That&rsquo;s a really sad proof.</p>

<p>It turns out that I really should have been working the other way round &mdash; first establish the orthogonal idempotents (the proof of which is really simple and elegant, I was just trapped in a single thread of thought), then use that to compute the convolution of irreducible characters.</p>

<p>I feel like this is worth presenting (as the only proof I saw online is the really sad one above), so I TeX&#8217;ed it up. I tried to convert to MathJax HTML but eventually gave up (that&rsquo;s the story for another post). So, the write-up is in good ol&#8217; PDF, available <a href="/pdf/20141119-convolution-of-irreducible-characters.pdf">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>AT&amp;T finally delivered my iPhone 6 Plus (silver, 64 GB) after about fifty days since preorder… The 1080p Retina display is simply stunning. However, it turns out that my old videos don’t work so well on 6 Plus’s giant screen. My old mobile video collection was optimized for my 16 GB 4S, targeting the small screen and highly limited storage — you guessed it, they were resized to 960x540, and they looked great. But they’re not up to the task any more. 960x540 videos aren’t at all sharp on the stunning screen of 6 Plus, which is more than capable of handling 4x pixels. Therefore, I have no choice but to feed it more pixels. I’m left in a weird situation, where my 1080p desktop (or even HDTV) quality videos should fit the screen just fine, but H.264 profile stands in the way. iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are only capable of High Profile level 4.2, so anything encoded in level 5.1, for instance, needs to be re-encoded. Also there are still MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 videos out there (MPEG-4 should be obsolete by now, I assume, but some people still use it; and MPEG-2 is de facto in TV broadcasts), which have to be transcoded. Okay, it’s a daunting task to re-encode a fairly big collection, but I have to do it sooner or later. Presumably this weekend. I’ll also report whether 720p videos look sharp on the screen later.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today (I mean November 7, 2014 — it’s technically November 8 at the time of writing) I saw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_%28film%29"><em>Interstellar</em></a> (IMAX digital) at AMC Mercado 20. I rarely go to movie theaters, less on the release day (film formats of <em>Interstellar</em> were released on November 5, and digital formats followed on November 7). However, reviews of it were positive (from the physics community), and I really need a way to release stress these days — I wasn’t in the right condition for months. So I figured I’d just spend an afternoon in front of the big screen.</p>

<p>I’ve heard good things about IMAX 70mm film, like no trailers, among other things. But I didn’t bother the extra seven miles’ drive to Hackworth IMAX Dome, so I landed on IMAX digital. Still a pretty stunning experience, although I ended up watching forty minutes worth of trailers before the real thing (arrived fifteen minutes early). In hindsight maybe I’d be better off spending some extra time on the road.</p>

<p>Speaking of the movie itself, they tried to make it as plausible as possible from a physics viewpoint, by involving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kip_Thorne">Kip Thorne</a> of Caltech. (There’s even a book out, <em>The Science of Interstellar</em>.) For instance, the wormhole isn’t portrayed as a hole (I mean, imagine a ring in empty space, as you would picture in your mind when you hear the word “hole” out of nothing; that’s not how it looks like here, and there’s a nice explanation). Some of the physics still doesn’t work out quite well, though, like Cooper’s not crushed at the singularity… Also there are communications from within the horizon and breakdown of causality, explained in the movie as happening in four dimension slices of some five dimensional spacetime where time could be a physical dimension. Obviously these are needed to get the sci-fi story going, so no one should be blamed.</p>

<p>I was there for the sci-fi and physics, but a nice surprise was that I was also touched by the humanity elements of story, I mean, family and stuff.</p>

<p>The downside: Cooper’s accent was a bit hard on me ☹</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For some reason, I only learned about this year’s laureates today, through <a href="http://motls.blogspot.com/2014/11/ex-employer-wont-meet-blue-led-nobel.html">the reference frame</a>. The prize goes to the inventors of the LED. Not exciting at all, so I don’t care if I’m ever informed. (Lubos has a good point on why applied physics — well, let’s even widen the concept of applied physics a bit — should not surprise anyone when they appear in a Nobel Prize announcement: “After all, Alfred Nobel might have very well considered his dynamite to be a discovery in physics, too.”)</p>

<p>The Nobel Prize Physics Awards has been rather amusing in recent years. Partly due to controversy on the theoretical front and no breakthrough on the experimental front, I guess. (The discovery of Higgs was a breakthrough to some extent, but it was totally expected; little physics beyond SM at LHC before LS1 is sad. Since it was totally expected, the award went to theorists — some experimentalists might not be too thrilled.) Just look at the recent list: 2010, graphene (shouldn’t that be chemistry? if material science can be part of physics, then chemistry must surely encompass it, too); 2009, CCD sensor (whatever that means, maybe that’s important); 2008, fibers (okay, I love fast Internet connections). The list actually goes all the way down to early 20th century, but it’s much denser in recent decades. Now one more: 2014, LED.</p>

<blockquote><p>“for the invention of efficient blue light-emitting diodes which has enabled bright and energy-saving white light sources”</p></blockquote>

<p>Wow, energy-saving. I guess next year’s prize will go to the inventors of high efficiency urinals, for being resource-saving.
<strong>I mean, LEDs are great, but not great as physics, much less a physics breakthrough.</strong></p>

<p>Let’s compare the applied folks to other laureates: Lorentz, J. J. Thomson, Planck, Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, Schrödinger, Dirac, Fermi, Pauli, Born, Lee, Yang, Landau, Feynman, Schwinger, Gell-Mann, Weinberg, ’t Hooft, etc. Not on the same level.</p>

<p>It’s good to see that a growing body of physicists are (or at least as it seems to me) increasingly reserved about the Nobel Prize, and prizes in general. Same goes for math, with the Nobel Prize replaced by something else. (Employers still love the big titles, I suppose — good to have some star faculty on board.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apple is pushing Yosemite hard and secretly Yosemitizing things. iTunes was updated to its shiny new look on Mavericks, day one upon Yosemite launch. I liked it. The only problems I had with the new iTunes are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It&rsquo;s no longer possible to go to the Artists view and Music Videos view with one click. Artists is now a drop-down menu option in My Music view; Music Videos is now a sidebar tab in Playlists view.</p></li>
<li><p>The red icon doesn&rsquo;t look as good as the previous blue one, and it doesn&rsquo;t harmonize too well alongside the blue Finder and Mail. Maybe they will look better together in Yosemite.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Just now I found that the Mac App Store in Mavericks is also Yosemitized:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/T7KIo6s.png" alt="Yosemitized Mac App Store" /></p>

<p>The chromeless UI certainly looks a bit weird, and the font seems a bit too small. However, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll quickly get over these shortcomings, and might even grow to appreciate them. Even more so when I finally upgrade to Yosemite (I&rsquo;ll wait for Thanksgiving break or 10.10.1 this year, whichever comes first — looks like the former will come first, considering the first 10.10.1 developer beta was out <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2014/11/03/first-yosemite-10-10-1-beta-now-available/">merely two days ago</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/IVFV7E2.png">reportedly</a> focusing on WiFi, etc.).</p>

<p>On the font side, unfortunately the small font size in the new Mac App Store does make text fuzzy on my non-Retina display. I didn&rsquo;t notice the fuzziness in the new iTunes. Anyway, everything is optimized for Retina — Apple is also secretly pushing Retina hard. In the Apple ecosystem, apparently you always want to stay at the top of the line. Due to Apple&rsquo;s nature, the degree of hardware-software integration is simply unparalleled, so only the latest hardware enjoys all the new features and love. Unfortunately, the typical lifespan of a Mac is much longer than the hardware/software release cycle.</p>

<p>The truth is, we (or at least I) adapt to things much quicker and easier than we&rsquo;d imagined (or otherwise would be willing to admit). When iOS 7 was demo&#8217;ed on WWDC 2013, I was like &ldquo;no way! What&rsquo;s with those stupid flat crap?&rdquo; But when the update came, I hopped on and was happy ever since. (I reserve my opinion on the icon design.) Later when I installed an app that was not updated for the new UI, I was like &ldquo;OMG, what&rsquo;s with this clumsy UI?&rdquo; I guess legibility issues, WiFi issues (with Yosemite) and responsiveness issue (with iOS 8 on iPhone 4S — <em>AT&amp;T, where&rsquo;s my preordered 6 Plus?</em>) are harder to impossible to adapt to, but they will eventually be fixed, or support-dropped, or hardware-upgraded (with $$). So in the end (almost) everyone will be happy. And one day when we face the old thing again by chance, we&rsquo;ll flee as fast as we can: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s with that&hellip;&rdquo; (I did exaggerate. Also, I know, many people just don&rsquo;t care about design, or have ill tastes, or can&rsquo;t find the buttons after a minimal number of UI tweaks — I&rsquo;m not including them in the &ldquo;we&rdquo; here.) Those who claim that &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t upgrade until&hellip;&rdquo; are just kidding themselves, and certainly no one will wait for them or make their &ldquo;until&hellip;&rdquo; come true. Most of those &ldquo;won&rsquo;t upgrade&rdquo; folks will eventually upgrade and be happy. For those that really don&rsquo;t upgrade (like those still running Snow Leopard) either can&rsquo;t afford the new hardware, or suffer from senility (seen from the deep hostility towards new things). Or they have some important legacy software that would break with an upgrade; poor dudes.</p>

<p>Same goes for newer, shinier, seemingly unnecessary deluxe hardware. I&rsquo;m still stuck on a Mid-2012 MBP 13&#8221; Non-Retina. Retina seems highly useless for me since I do most of my work on the 27&#8221; external display — the 13&#8221; internal LCD hosts a single maximized Activity Monitor window most of the time (and sometimes also a Transmission window). I expect my opinion about Retina to change after I upgrade to a Retina model next year. (It will be a pretty major purchase though — i7, 16 GB memory, and 512 GB SSD are musts, and there are like a million peripherals to buy — Thunderbolt to Ethernet, Super Drive, etc., etc.) This shift of opinion after upgrading to something unnecessarily good (and ending up not being able to tolerate anything inferior) is best described as &ldquo;<strong>sadly converted</strong>&rdquo;. Some folks are already sadly converted by the Retina iMac. See, for example, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/11/yes-the-5k-retina-imacs-screen-runs-at-60hz-at-5k-resolution/#p11">this article</a> on Ars Technica:</p>

<blockquote><p>Prior to getting the Retina iMac on my desk, I would have said that &ldquo;retina&rdquo; isn’t necessarily something we need on the desktop. Most people don’t notice pixels on the desktop at a normal seating distance. However, after getting to A/B compare the Retina iMac with the standard one over the course of a week, I’m sadly converted. I just don’t know if my wallet can take the abuse.</p></blockquote>

<p>And others are bitterly desiring one (me included — sadly two Mac are too much for a university dorm). See, for example, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/11/yes-the-5k-retina-imacs-screen-runs-at-60hz-at-5k-resolution/?comments=1&amp;post=27896871">this comment</a> on the aforementioned article:</p>

<blockquote><p>I WISH APPLE TECHNICA WOULD STOP WITH ALL THESE ARTICLES ABOUT THE IMAC.</p>

<p>It really makes me want one unjustifiably.</p></blockquote>

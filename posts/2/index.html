  <div class="entry-content"><p>I happened to check my imgur account just now (haven&rsquo;t been to the web interface for ages), and you know what, I have uploaded 10,744 images since I created the account in February this year! (I&rsquo;ve been using imgur for longer than that; previously I uploaded images anonymously.) Most of the 10k images were uploaded via scripts using the API. This again demonstrates the importance of a good API — without the imgur API I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to upload hundreds of images with a few keystrokes all in a snap, and getting links would be a huge pain in the ass. There are myriad image hosting services out there, but imgur rules &lsquo;em all, thanks to its decent API (and also its good CDN and direct image links, of course).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently tried and purchased <a href="https://aptonic.com/dropzone3/">Dropzone 3</a>. See a list of features on the linked official website. In short, Dropzone 3 provides an intermediate zone for drag-n-drop. You can use it as a stash (called &ldquo;Drop Bar&rdquo; — stacking is available), use it as a shortcut by putting frequently used folders and applications there, or trigger actions by dropping. There are a dozen builtin actions and <a href="https://aptonic.com/dropzone3/actions/">an additional list of readily available actions</a>, covering common web drives, SNS and file sharing sites. <strong>Better yet, you can develop your custom actions with the easy-to-use <a href="https://github.com/aptonic/dropzone3-actions/blob/master/README.md#dzalerttitle-message">Ruby API</a>.</strong> For instance, I wrote a simple Google Translate action, <code>Google Translate.dzbundle</code> (<a href="https://gist.github.com/zmwangx/b27f106a8ba47468a43d">link</a>), based on <a href="https://github.com/soimort/translate-shell">translate-shell</a>. (You know, it&rsquo;s Ruby, so calling external commands and concatenating strings feel at home, as if you are coding in Perl or directly in shell; unlike Python, where you at least need to <code>import subprocess</code> then <code>subprocess.check_output</code> to get the output of an external command, and have to use a bunch of stupid <code>+</code>&rsquo;s to get your goddamn message to print.)</p>

<p>Although I use the terminal for most tasks, drag-n-drop is still useful and convenient at times, not to mention the custom actions. (And the stock drag-n-drop is kinda hit-and-miss, especially for people like me who are mostly working with windows maximized — except terminal windows.) After using Dropzone 3 for a while, I found it well worth $4.99.</p>

<p>Wait, I didn&rsquo;t mention the pricing? Dropzone 3 is only <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dropzone-3/id695406827?ls=1&amp;mt=12">$4.99 on MAS</a>, so get it while supplies last. (Somehow the license is $10 on the developer&rsquo;s online store, so definitely buy from MAS and change to the <a href="https://aptonic.com/dropzone3/sandboxing.php">unsandboxed version</a> later — de-sandboxing is free.) There&rsquo;s also a 15-day free trial.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was cleaning up my Opera bookmarks just now — I&rsquo;m semi-officially leaving Opera for Safari. Of course, Safari still can&rsquo;t handle everything (e.g., Adblock Plus is still not so good on Safari, YouTubeCenter lags behind and I don&rsquo;t bother to compile myself — yes, I have a certificate, and some power user features simply don&rsquo;t exist), so I&rsquo;m still going to Opera/Opera beta/Chrome/Firefox for certain tasks. But Safari is very nice. For the first time.</p>

<p>I started out as a Chrome user (well, don&rsquo;t want to recall the IE days), branched out to the Chromium Opera, and now ended up in Safari. Not sure about the future. When I look back, something nostalgic pops up in mind — <a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/">the Google Chrome Comic</a>. I enjoyed it more than once, but I never seemed to have archived it. So here it is, combined into <a href="/pdf/2008-chrome-comic.pdf">one PDF</a>. In fact, you can create the PDF yourself:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>seq 0 39 | parallel wget -q http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/images/big/{}.jpg
</span><span class='line'>convert $(ls -v *.jpg) 2008-chrome-comic.pdf</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here I was a bit lazy and used a GNU <code>ls</code> feature: <code>-v</code> for natural sorting of numbers (doesn&rsquo;t work for BSD <code>ls</code>).</p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s page 1 of the comic as a teaser:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Emacs is notorious for its loading time. For me, this is especially annoying when I&rsquo;m editing LaTeX files — AUCTeX takes about five seconds to load, and once I exit Emacs (especially after a quick edit), all that work is wasted, and next time I want to do some quick editing with that same LaTeX file — sorry, another five seconds.</p>

<p>This problem can be solved by &ldquo;using that same Emacs&rdquo;, i.e., running Emacs in server mode, then connecting to the server via <code>emacsclient</code>. Below is my script, which I call <code>emc</code>, to make <code>emacsclient</code> more user-friendly. <code>emc</code> opens a file (given as <code>$1</code>) on the server, launching one on its way if none is detected. Note that I used <code>-cqta=</code> for <code>emacsclient</code>. The <code>-c</code> option is <code>--create-frame</code>, i.e., create a new frame (in the current tty, for instance) instead of using the existing frame (in another tty, for instance); this allows for multiple frames accross different ttys. The <code>-q</code> option is for <code>--quiet</code>, suppressing messages like &ldquo;Waiting for Emacs&hellip;&rdquo; The <code>-t</code> option is for <code>--tty</code>, or equivalently, the familiar <code>-nw</code> option of <code>emacs</code>. The <code>-a=</code> options is <code>--alternate-editor=</code>; according to the manpage, <code>-a, --alternate-editor=EDITOR</code> has the following effect:</p>

<blockquote><p>if the Emacs server is not running, run the specified editor instead. This can also be specified via the `ALTERNATE_EDITOR&#8217; environment variable. If the value of EDITOR is the empty string,  run `emacs &ndash;daemon&#8217; to start Emacs in daemon mode, and try to connect to it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Note that <code>emacsclient</code> requires a filename, so my script prompts for one if <code>$1</code> is empty.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>emc</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nv">file</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$1</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">else</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="k">fi</span>
</span><span class='line'>emacsclient -cqta<span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;${file}&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note that using <code>emacsclient</code> has the additional benefit that the same buffer is simultaneously updated accross different ttys (See screenshot, where I opened the current post in two different ttys). This way, you won&rsquo;t face the nasty &ldquo;file changed on disk&rdquo; problem when you accidentally edited the same file in another tty session.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9KxEWKq.png" alt="screen shot of multiple copies of the same buffer" /></p>

<p>By the way, remember to re-configure your other programs that uses an external editor. For instance, change <code>$EDITOR</code> to <code>emacsclient -cqta=</code> in your <code>env</code>, and <code>core.editor</code> to <code>emacsclient -cqta=</code> in your <code>~/.gitconfig</code>.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: if you use <code>emacsclient</code> to edit git commit messages in Git Commit Mode, remember to use <code>C-c C-c</code> (<code>git-commit-commit</code>) to save the commit message rather than using <code>server-edit</code> or <code>C-x C-c</code> to exit Emacs. Otherwise, the <code>COMMIT_EDITMSG</code> buffer will persist in the Emacs server, and you&rsquo;ll be prompted to revert buffer the next time you edit another commit message, which is pretty annoying.</p>

<p>I just started using <code>emacsclient</code>, so the above script might be buggy in certain edge cases. I&rsquo;ll report when I run into issues.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Once in a while (maybe a year, maybe several months — not set in stone), I give big name free services not in use a chance to convince me. Evernote is one such service. The interface used to look very cheap and cluttered. I hated it. However, this time I&rsquo;m sold. Now everything Evernote, from its Mac app to its iOS app to its web design to its physical products, looks distinctively Mac-like. (I use Mac-like to refer to Apple&rsquo;s design philosophy, including iOS. Well, I guess the Android and Windows apps aren&rsquo;t Mac-like.) I mean, just look at the screenshots:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/AZelofm.png" alt="Web UI, beta" />
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/tZuWBlY.png" alt="Evernote Market, Pfeiffer Collection" />
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/R4QF8OM.png" alt="Mac app" /></p>

<p>Bright, simplistic, elegant, clutter-free. Mac-like. The Mac app takes advantage of the translucent material of Yosemite, and it looks gorgeous. The iOS app also feels great on a full HD Retina screen; I didn&rsquo;t bother to take a screenshot. Now it&rsquo;s much likely that I&rsquo;ll put it into good use — cluttered and cheap-looking interfaces give me nightmares and actually hinders my productivity, and now they are gone.</p>

<p>No one can argue that Apple products make great screenshots. They are also much more intuitive, functional, and productive than most Windows folks are willing to believe. I hope our world is more Mac-like.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is not the first time that a distraction free writing app is featured on the Mac App Store. This time the candidate is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/desk/id915839505?mt=12">Desk</a>. The official website is <a href="http://desk.pm">here</a>, but licensing is MAS-exclusive. The icon looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/OprXSEU.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Skeuomorphism, oh man. And this is the only screenshot I can find on the official website:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/WBaYzho.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I can find a few other screenshots on MAS, but you know how shitty MAS screenshots are, plus the screenshots of this app only focus on specific UI elements. The official website also features an intro video (which provides no information at all) and a brief feature list with no further details, all on one page. The MAS description is somewhat more comprehensive, but again, &ldquo;WordPress integration&rdquo; and the like are not so informative. So, after a certain amount of research, I have to say I know little about this app. To do the app justice, there&rsquo;s an <a href="http://blog.desk.pm">accompanying blog</a>, with all kinds of noise though — like what a good blog should be, no complaint about that. So I guess anyone who wants to know more about this app should go digging there. Not me, so I didn&rsquo;t read.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, reception is great, although the price tag is currently set at $30 — definitely a premium price. John Gruber <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/11/22/desk">has a piece</a>, but I think &ldquo;My thanks to Johb Saddington for sponsoring this weeks&#8217; DF RSS feed to promote Desk, his blogging app for the Mac&rdquo; kind of defeats credability. MAS featuring is also a good sign (although not always). Out of the 55 MAS ratings at the time of writing (9:42 PM, Friday, December 5, 2014), 45 are five stars.</p>

<p>That brings home my curiosity about &ldquo;distraction free writing apps&rdquo; in general. <em>Why would anyone pay $30 for a &ldquo;distraction free writing app&rdquo; (which basically justifies any lack of feature — &ldquo;we deliberately give you no choice for anything so you can focus on writing!&rdquo;), <strong>without even a trial</strong>?</em> MAS is such a bad model for utility and productivity software since you can&rsquo;t just look at five screenshots (seriously?) and decide &ldquo;this is for me!&rdquo; Yet I have the impression that more developers prefer this model nowadays, especially in this focused-writing business, another example being IA Writer. Sure it makes licensing and combating piracy simple, but again, I need to feel it to decide if it&rsquo;s the right tool for me, especially for a feature-deprived focused-writing app. (This is a general thought — in this case I don&rsquo;t need to feel it to tell that it&rsquo;s not for me.)</p>

<p>More specifically, let&rsquo;s think about distraction free writing. What does IA Writer, or Desk, or other apps offer that&rsquo;s not already available to you with your OS? They support Markdown syntax highlighting, or even WYSYWYG (but only the very simple kind of WYSYWYG limited by the Markdown feature set), sure. They support some select-and-click type of formatting (by the way, Desk&rsquo;s formatting tools look a lot like those found on medium.com), which is good for some who are not competent enough to type simple markups, I guess. Desk supports drag-and-drop of media (although I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s limited to certain platforms and not portable at all — I always upload images to Imgur and embed the Imgur links, which is super simple for me since I have several homemade scripts to take care of that). So are these features essential? Not at all. For the general public, plain Markdown without rendering should be more than enough, since Markdown was designed to be human-readable as plain text in the first place. Markdown only gets ugly when you have a lot of inline hyperlinks, or worse still, plain HTML tags, but that&rsquo;s not what I would expect from the general public. The technical population who do probably need the rendering, on the other hand, aren&rsquo;t the target audience of these apps; certain needs of the technical folks are hardly ever addressed by these feature-deprived focused-writing apps — e.g., where are my keybindings (full-featured, not just C-k, C-y, C-p, C-n, C-b, C-f, M-del, etc.; in particular, what about M-d, M-b, etc.)? What about custom Markdown engine? What about Jekyll integration (no need for that, actually — I&rsquo;m happy with tty)? So, to sum up, for the target audience, realtime rendering isn&rsquo;t necessary, although I guess people with technophobia hate to see markups like <code>**</code> so no rendering will kill them. Second point, select-and-click type of formatting, is already dismissed. Third point, drag-and-drop of media might be useful for some people, but not all. After all, Desk uses a typewriter as its icon, and there&rsquo;s no way you could throw photos into your typewriter. It&rsquo;s about writing, and most of the time writing is enough.</p>

<p>I have dismissed the &ldquo;additional features&rdquo; of focused-writing apps as non-essential. And I can argue that they are actually sources of distraction — as soon as you have WYSYWYG and formatting and mouse, you could, in principle, begin to fiddle. But when I say &ldquo;additional features&rdquo;, you might ask, &ldquo;additional&rdquo; compared to what? Okay here&rsquo;s the magic. The magic is designed by Apple in California®, and it&rsquo;s present on every single Mac running OS X. It&rsquo;s called TextEdit.app. Distraction free? How can you be more distraction free than this:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/z3LEu0U.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s either text or blank. Nothing else. It&rsquo;s more than capable of handling plain text, our best friend (and computer&rsquo;s best friend — the universal interface). You can customize the font once and for all, or you can even live with the factory setting. That&rsquo;s better than having a font you don&rsquo;t like forced upon you, as many of those focused-writing apps do. You can even auto save to iCloud if you&rsquo;d like to. Of course there&rsquo;s no one click publishing or timeline management or whatever, but you could leave that to a publishing app (like Desk, when used as a publishing app). Better yet, you can use Jekyll or Octopress or whatever command line solution, where everything is at your fingertip, a few keystrokes away. No limitation whatsoever. But that&rsquo;s out of question for most people. (The easy-to-use command line interface, and not needing to worry about hosting myself, are two of the primary reasons that brought me to Octopress on GitHub Pages, rather than wordpress.com or self-hosted wordpress.org).</p>

<p>Of course I&rsquo;m not saying TextEdit is good enough as a text editor (it is good enough for most people, though), or it is my text editor of choice. My text editor has always been Emacs, which can be distraction free when I need it to be (I&rsquo;ve hidden everything I feel like to hide), and which can be an almost feature-complete operating system when I need it to be. Apart from a slightly frustrating loading time, there&rsquo;s no such bullshit as &ldquo;we deliberately left no feature and no choice to you so you won&rsquo;t fiddle.&rdquo; Mostly importantly, it is extensible — I can start writing Elisp right away, and every single line of code I write can potentially save me thousands of keystrokes in the future; I don&rsquo;t need to submit a feature request to the developer and wait forever (usually power users&#8217; feature requests are ignored, unless the software was built for power users to begin with or mainly popular within power users). Plus Emacs is free (both as in beer and in speech), rather than being proprietary and costing $30. At any rate, when I&rsquo;m writing in Emacs, most of the time I&rsquo;m just furiously typing away — no distraction whatsoever. That&rsquo;s the ideal state of writing, and I feel really good at those moments. That&rsquo;s the main charm of writing, at least to me.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2Jx9Mpv.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The whole command line experience is awesome (most of what I do with the computer are either done in the browser or in iTerm2 — well, plus some time spent with PDF in Preview.app and some with emails in Mail.app). And most of my tools either ship with the operating system (OS X is a great operating system), or are FOSS. Things that hardly ever die. Of course the command line experience is infeasible for laymen, but my argument is, <strong>most of the time the things you need are already there, e.g., TextEdit.</strong> I feel bad about those folks who are constantly on the lookout for distraction-free writing apps, and pay a ridiculous amount for them — only to distract themselves. Just open TextEdit and type away (or if you&rsquo;re capable of it, Emacs or Vim or SublimeText or TextMate or BBEdit or whatever). That&rsquo;s the most productive thing to do. <strong>Publishing is not the top priority; writing is, and it&rsquo;s really simple.</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I never realized that in Python 3 Unicode is the default; in particular, <code>str</code> in Python 3 is practically equivalent to <code>unicode</code> in Python 2. This might be the <em>one thing</em> that convince me to migrate. <code>str.encode()</code>, <code>str.decode()</code>, <code>unicode.encode()</code>, <code>unicode.decode()</code>, etc. are so confusing that I&rsquo;m never 100% sure what I&rsquo;m doing (only-occasionally-used-but-unavoidable-and-worst-of-all-very-confusing &ldquo;features&rdquo; are nightmares).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been using the Chromuim Opera for a long time, after Chrome&rsquo;s design went unbearably ugly around v32 (IIRC Opera stable channel was on v19 when I switched, which was released on January 28, 2014). From then on, Opera&rsquo;s <a href="http://help.opera.com/opera/Mac/1583/en/fasterBrowsing.html#advanced">advanced keyboard shortcuts</a> has become an integral part of my browsing habit. In particular, the following are especially handy for me:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>1</code>: Cycle left through tabs;</li>
<li><code>2</code>: Cycle right through tabs;</li>
<li><code>/</code>: Find on page;</li>
<li><code>Z</code>: Go back one page;</li>
<li><code>X</code>: Go forward one page;</li>
<li><code>0</code>: Zoom in;</li>
<li><code>9</code>: Zoom out;</li>
<li><code>6</code>: Reset zoom to 100%.</li>
</ul>


<p>Lately, with the Yosemite release, Safari has become a much more competitive browser. I won&rsquo;t say why, and I admit that it has major missing features that still prevents it from becoming my default — but I have to say I’m gradually moving more of more of my browsing, especially reading, to Safari. It would be nice if I could carry my power user shortcuts with me. Fortunately, this is possible. Just modify the plist in the following way:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>safari-advanced-keyboard-shortcuts.sh</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="s1">&quot;Back&quot;=&quot;z&quot;;</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="s1">&quot;Zoom Out&quot;=&quot;9&quot;;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s1">}&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Relaunch Safari. You are all set! Enjoy the ultrafast single key navigating experience. To reset,</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<hr />

<p><strong><em>2014/12/22 Update:</em></strong></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s one caveat to this approach — unlike in Opera, where the default layman shortcuts (e.g., ⌘F) are still available when advanced keyboard shorts are enabled, in Safari they are simply overwritten. This is annoying when the web page or web app binds certain keys, especially <code>/</code> to its own search bar (a notable example being google.com). In that case I have to admit defeat and click on the menu bar item, which takes a hundred times as long as a single <code>/</code> keystroke.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I&rsquo;m officially going <a href="http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html">Diceware</a>. I published my simple C implementation of diceware on <a href="https://github.com/zmwangx/diceware">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using 1Password for a couple years now, and I&rsquo;ve always been a bit worried about my master password. It&rsquo;s a ~30 byte monster with uppercase, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. By any measure it is very safe. The problem is there are (extremely) personal things in there. I assembled several unrelated things that I (secretly) hold dearest to my heart, obfuscated them with rules not found in best64, and mixed with semi-gibberish. My daily login password is a combo similar in nature, with less obfuscation to facilitate typing. People who dig really deep into my identity might be able to compromise it (or not); I&rsquo;m afraid that I&rsquo;m more predictable than I thought I was. I know, the worry is pretty much unwarranted, as I’m not likely the target of a focused attack — I’m neither rich nor equipped with sensitive information or power, and for wide-range exploits, 99.9% of people are lower-hanging fruits. Even for a targeted attack, <a href="http://xkcd.com/538/">xkcd 538: Security</a> broke a crypto nerd’s imagination with a $5 wrench. However, a geek is a geek, you can’t block a geek’s imagination.</p>

<p>Therefore, after worrying for so long, today I’m going Diceware. Eight diceware words give you at least 100 bits of true entropy. Unfortunately I don’t have a die, and don’t bother to get one. (Amazon Prime: get it Monday? No. Target, six miles away? No.) So I read my random bits from <code>/dev/urandom</code>. The C implementation is <a href="https://github.com/zmwangx/diceware">here</a>. By publishing this I’m announcing to the world that I’m using diceware. But I’m not afraid, since I’m now protected by true entropy that’s not compromised by publishing the scheme.</p>

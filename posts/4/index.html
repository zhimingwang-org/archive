  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>10/28/2014 Update:</strong></p>

<p>Yesterday Microsoft pushed an update to OneDrive.app to MAS. After uninstalling, reinstalling, and wiping the 10 GB folder I&rsquo;d like to sync (that&rsquo;s for photos; I upload videos via the web interface) on both client and server sides, it actually began to work. The speed was around 1 MB/s during my last sync of 10 GB worth of data. Not fast, but I will be fairly satisfied if it can keep up with that speed. Time will tell.</p>

<hr />

<p>The OneDrive team just <a href="https://blog.onedrive.com/office-365-onedrive-unlimited-storage/">announced on their blog</a> that</p>

<blockquote><p>Today, storage limits just became a thing of the past with Office 365. Moving forward, all Office 365 customers will get unlimited OneDrive storage at no additional cost.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hell, I hate Microsoft, but <strong>I have to say that this is big</strong>. OneDrive might not be the first to offer unlimited cloud storage (not sure), but it is certainly the first one to roll it out on such a grand scale. Remember, Office 365 is just $99.99 a year. OneDrive might not be the best cloud storage service, especially for OS X customers, but unlimited is unlimited — in comparison, I pay Google $9.99 a month for 1 TB.</p>

<p>Microsoft products are indeed pure crap on a Mac. Office for Mac 2011 is horrible (speed and bloat aside, some features are simply not implemented — try to import a UTF-8 CSV into Excel, all non-ASCII characters become underscores; Microsoft’s response was that Unicode import was not implemented yet). OneDrive.app is slow like crawl, and it never finishes syncing — always stuck on the last few megabytes, eating up 100% CPU. Thank god I only use it for backups. The web interface is okay, although Google Drive is faster — blazing fast, I can easily upload with 20+MB/s. But again, <strong>unlimited is unlimited.</strong></p>

<p>Microsoft is opening a new chapter of cloud storage. In today’s world, we have so many huge video files, so storage limit should indeed be something of the past. This is a smart move for Microsoft — when you have, say, 100 TB up there (which seems very far at this moment, but what if all contents go 4K), and if competitors don’t offer comparable plans, then you are stuck with Microsoft. And Office. Oh my god, Microsoft Office must die.</p>

<p>Of course I don’t want to be stuck with Microsoft, so I’m looking at how Google and Apple will handle this. Google ought to offer more affordable plans, preferably also unlimited. (My 1Password still has it that I purchased Office for Mac University 2011 on Nov 12, 2012 for $99.99. That turned into a free 4-year Office 365 subscription, which contains 60 world minutes of Skype per month, 1 TB of OneDrive — oh, now it’s about to go unlimited. All for $99.99. In comparison, Google charges me $119.88 per year.) Apple wants you to save everything to iCloud, and it introduced iCloud Drive and Cloud Kit this year — but plans still start at 5 GB and tops out at 1 TB, seriously? Dude, you sell top notch hardware with huge profits; why don’t you pay your customers back by offering better cloud storage — that’s also better for iCloud.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong><em>11/02/2014 update:</em></strong></p>

<p>See <a href="/blog/2014/11/02/vobcopy-dvdbackup-etc/">this post</a> for issues, explanations, and more.</p>

<hr />

<p>Today it occurred to me that I should make clones of my audio CDs (as stand-alone ISO images, I mean, not just rsyncing the AIFFs to subdirectories in <code>~/aud/lossless</code>). One can never have too many backups.</p>

<p>Of course I could simply pack the aforementioned directories with AIFFs into ISOs — that’s not impressive. The end result might actually be the same, but I want to make the clones directly from the original CDs. It turns out that this is not so simple with the Disk Utility GUI — unlike DVDs, the “New Image” option is grayed out for Audio CDs. I’m not sure why, but maybe they want you to just use iTunes to deal with Audio CDs (which works well for all practical purposes — but theoretical curiosity never ends).</p>

<p>So there comes <code>hdiutil</code>. <code>hdiutil</code> and <code>diskutil</code> are the utilities underlying Disk Utility. Unfortunately, so far I know little about them except for simplest things like <code>diskutil list</code>, <code>diskutil mount</code>, <code>hdiutil attach -stdinpass</code>, etc. (I&rsquo;m so ignorant about anything filesystem related!) The <code>hdiutil</code> verb that makes cross-platform CD or DVD is <code>makehybrid</code>, which supports the following filesystem options: <code>-hfs</code> (holy crap, no HFS+ please! Apple ought to replace this thirty-year-old filesystem — ZFS or something better please!), <code>-iso</code>, <code>-joliet</code>, and <code>-udf</code>. For Audio CDs you use <code>-iso</code> and with <code>-joliet</code> extension:</p>

<pre><code>hdiutil makehybrid -iso -joliet -o AUDIO_CD_NAME.iso SOURCE
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>SOURCE</code> can be the mount point, the disk device file, etc. Similarly, although you can create <code>.cdr</code> images from DVDs via the Disk Utility GUI, you can also do it with <code>hdiutil</code> (which is potentially more portable — I’ve never heard a definitive answer of whether renaming <code>.cdr</code> to <code>.iso</code> really cross-platform):</p>

<pre><code>hdiutil makehybrid -udf -o DVD_NAME.iso SOURCE
</code></pre>

<p>This way CSS keys <em>seem</em> to be cloned as well, since I was able to authenticate such a CSS-protected DVD with <code>libdvdread</code>.</p>

<hr />

<p>P.S. I sincerely hope that one day lossless music tracks are no longer distributed through CD-ROMs. So painful — even my Internet speed is more than ten times faster than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-ROM#Transfer_rates">highest transfer rate</a> available from any CD-ROM. (I’ve heard about some websites distributing lossless music digitally, but that won’t happen to the music I care about in the near future.) I still like physical albums though — a real sense of possession. Maybe they should contain the physical goodies and some sort of access codes?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>DaisyDisk is a pretty famous name. I’ve heard a lot that DaisyDisk is beautiful, but as a “power user” I always feel ashamed about using a disk analyzer or visualizer (although no one really cares). I’m pretty comfortable with doing most filesystem operations right in the shell, and for other tasks too tedious for the shell (like renaming a bunch of files with no obvious pattern), Finder (equipped with TotalFinder) works just fine.</p>

<p>Today I was trying clean up my drive a bit, as there were only 22GB left. I knew where the main problem lied: a huge number of highres videos lying in <code>~/vid/staging</code>, awaiting renaming and migration to my external drive. Anyway, it would be nice to have some visualization of a detailed breakdown of my disk usage, preferably on any level I want without multiple passes of <code>du</code>. The name DaisyDisk popped up from the cache in my brain, so I headed over to their website to download it.</p>

<p>The result is not disappointing at all. Look at this:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vyIwSNQ.png" alt="DaisyDisk screen shot" /></p>

<p>Beautiful. Moreover, functional. It indeed gives me a detailed breakdown on any level, within any directory (given enough priviledge). I can also collect items I don’t want and let DaisyDisk clean up for me at once (not surprising for a disk analyzer); this feature isn’t that useful for me since I know exactly where my queues of unorganized items are — <code>~/Downloads</code>, <code>~/aud/staging</code>, <code>~/img/staging</code>, and <code>~/vid/staging</code>.</p>

<p>By the way, DaisyDisk seems to be WinRAR-free. (Rest assured; I’m a good guy and I <em>will</em> purchase a license — these days whether to purchase the website or the MAS version is a headache, though.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just learned something new. Whenever you install a <code>pkg</code> on OS X, OS X stores a receipt of what was installed in <code>/var/db/receipts</code> (I&rsquo;m running OS X 10.9.5 at the time of writing), called a <strong>bom</strong> — bill of materials (I’d rather call it a manifest, whatever). This feature was introduced in NeXTSTEP. From <code>man 5 bom</code>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Mac OS X Installer uses a file system &ldquo;bill of materials&rdquo; to determine which files to install, remove, or upgrade. A bill of materials, <strong>bom</strong>, contains all the files within a directory, along with some information about each file. File information includes: the file&rsquo;s UNIX permissions, its owner and group, its size, its time of last modification, and so on.  Also included are a checksum of each file and information about hard links.</p></blockquote>

<p><code>man 5 bom</code> is actually badly maintained, as it says &ldquo;The bill of materials for installed packages are found within the package receipts located in /Library/Receipts,&rdquo; whereas those have been migrated to <code>/var/db/receipts</code> a long time ago.</p>

<p><code>.bom</code> files are binary, but you can access the contents via <code>lsbom</code>. For instance, to list the files installed,</p>

<pre><code>lsbom -f /var/db/receipts/org.macports.MacPorts.bom
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the paths printed are always relative to <code>/</code>. See <code>man 1 lsbom</code> for detailed option listing.</p>

<p>(Beware when you try to clean up unwanted packages using the <code>lsbom</code> listing. Packages might overwrite files, so make sure you review the listing first and know what you are doing. &ldquo;Knowing what you are doing&rdquo; is the prerequisite for using <code>sudo</code> anyway.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today&rsquo;s news has it that Charles Munger made a $65 million donation to KITP at UCSB. See for instance <a href="http://nyti.ms/1D4zg24">this article</a> on NYT. Of course I didn&rsquo;t learn it from NYT (I&rsquo;m generally sick of any news other than math, physics, or IT-related ones). I learned it from <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=7247">Not Even Wrong</a> instead (of course I don&rsquo;t agree with Woit, but some of his links are nice).</p>

<p>I have no interest whatsoever in the business world, so I have no idea about Warren Buffett&rsquo;s business partners (although I&rsquo;m still worldly enough to know Warren Buffett). However, the name Charles Munger sounded surprisingly familiar. After reading the sentence</p>

<blockquote><p>Mr. Munger has frequently donated big sums to schools like Stanford and the Harvard-Westlake School.</p></blockquote>

<p>from the NYT article linked above, it finally hit me that Mr. Munger is the donor of the Munger Graduate Residence here at Stanford. Munger is really nice, much better than our undergrad residences AFAIK (location-wise Roble is still unbeatable for mathematicians and physicists, although Munger still kicks EV&rsquo;s ass).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad to see more and more entrepreneurs funding physics, especially theoretical physics, whether they understand it or not. (<strong>Aside:</strong> Even for laypeople theoretical physics is cool isn&rsquo;t it, like the coolest kid in class. I won&rsquo;t comment on whether math is cooler, but breakthrough mathematical work certainly go largely unnoticed in the public, since theoretical physics is the last thing that laypeople can &ldquo;vaguely understand&rdquo;. Do some name searches on Google to see how math and physics play out in the limelight — hint:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gauss — 4,130,000 results;</li>
<li>Euler — 855,000 results;</li>
<li>Newton — 13,200,000 results;</li>
<li>Einstein — 6,330,000 results.</li>
</ul>


<p>End of aside.) Engaging in physics is plain better than engaging in some questionable philanthropy. (Have you heard that Gates Foundation invested in G4S, the largest private military and security company in the world? I’m not sure about the details — I once read that off a bathroom flyer — but that’s definitely interesting philanthropy.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong><em>11/02/2014 update:</em></strong></p>

<p>See <a href="/blog/2014/11/02/vobcopy-dvdbackup-etc/">this post</a> for issues, explanations, and more.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>10/25/2014 update:</em></strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m such an idiot. <code>vobcopy</code> is the real, hassel-free way to go.</p>

<pre><code>brew install vobcopy
</code></pre>

<p>Then, with the DVD mounted,</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>vobcopy</strong> without any options will copy the title with the most chapters into files of 2GB size into the current working directory.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course there are a ton of options, but I generally hate to browse through options unless I have to, so I&rsquo;m happy with calling without argument.</p>

<hr />

<p>Yesterday I was trying to rip a music video off a newly released DVD from Japan. I knew very little about how DRM (in this case, CSS) actually works and how to break it. I tried to operate directly on the VOB file with <code>ffmpeg</code> or <code>mpv</code> but both failed with a lot of header errors — I suppose more files than the VOB are required for authentication? Whatever, maybe I’ll learn the details in the future, but I don’t see the need since DVD is an outdated technology anyway.</p>

<p>So, can we proceed from here? Most certainly. I noticed that although <code>mpv</code> won’t let me play a single VOB, I can simply hand it the DVD mount point, and it will play the whole DVD seamlessly. <strong>Caution:</strong> <code>mpv</code> needs to be compiled with <code>libdvdnav</code> and <code>libdvdread</code>! With brew you just do</p>

<pre><code>brew install mpv --with-libdvdnav --with-libdvdread
</code></pre>

<p>For better performance and backup, I first cloned the DVD into a <code>.cdr</code> image (DVD/CD-R Master Image) using Disk Utility (I&rsquo;ve never tried creating/cloning image with <code>diskutil</code> CLI, so nothing to report on that). Then I mount the image, say the mount point is <code>/Volumes/UPBX_80165</code>. As said I can hand that mount point to <code>mpv</code> and it simply works, but how about extracting the MPEG-2 video stream? The <code>--stream-capture=&lt;filename&gt;</code> option is there just for you. In principle <code>--stream-dump=&lt;filename&gt;</code> should also work, but without monitoring the output and controlling where to end, I’m not sure if it will ever terminate itself when reading from a DVD (when I stream captured the DVD it just kept repeating itself until I explicitly quit with <code>q</code>). So that&rsquo;s it:</p>

<pre><code>mpv --stream-capture=dump.mpg /Volumes/UPBX_80165
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can torture the <code>dump.mpg</code> with <code>ffmpeg</code> however you want. The most obvious thing is to cut out the music video part, and put into a new container like MPEG-TS. Or transcode it to H.264 for your iPhone. The nice thing about <code>dump.mpg</code> is that, unless I got it wrong, there&rsquo;s no quality loss here — the only thing you got rid of is that goddamn DRM.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday, on an internet forum, I saw someone’s signature, which translates to</p>

<blockquote><p>Don’t even get started if you know you can&rsquo;t know from the beginning that you won&rsquo;t make it to the very end.</p></blockquote>

<p>This seems justified — persistence is the key to success; why even bother if you know you’ll fail? However, I have to profoundly disagree with this, and even dedicate a blog post to discussing this problem.</p>

<p>The problem here is, the real world is much more complicated than the idealized world found in various quotes about persistence. Most of the time you have absolutely no clue where which road is leading, unless you embark on the journey, clueless. As for me, fortunately I knew I was gonna be a mathematician/physicist ever since elementary school, so the roadmap is sorta clear on the grand scale. Still, all those tiny building blocks for the ultimate goal are confusing, and even more so for things hardly related to the ultimate goal, for instance, coding, which is just a hobby and a way to simplify life — it has simplified my life in some sense, but has itself complicated my life in other ways (your life inevitably becomes more complicated when you know more and want to find out even more).</p>

<p>And sometimes you are bound to fail — I know my code is shitty, for instance, but if I don’t get rolling, I won’t even have a working (albeit shitty) version that barely meets my needs. As another example, I was looking for a way to share and archive some photos. I started with <a href="http://apinkarchive.wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>, which turned out to be more formal and tiring than I’d thought. Then I ran a <a href="http://chorongmemories.tumblr.com/">Tumblr microblog</a>, which was great, but has certain limitations that in the end prevents it from being damn useful for myself, so in the end I went onto “indefinite hiatus.” In both cases I never declared that the thing was permanent — I was careful to say that the blogs were experimental, and I moved on when I found something better, or when they were no longer helping me. Yesterday I started yet another experiment, a <a href="http://apinkpcr.tistory.com">Tistory blog</a>. It is a random move triggered by something unexpected; the South Korean blogging platform is not that great, but at least it provides acceptable API access, and more importantly, I’ve got complete infrastructure built around the API to scrape photos, so it’s easy to build on top of that to automate things. It is also experimental. Again I’m not sure I long I can keep it up, but at least I’m happy with it for the time being. Being happy at the time being is the most important goal for hobbies.</p>

<p>Choices are hard. Especially in today’s world, tools in every discipline are constantly improving, be it math, physics, programming, photography, blogging, or whatever. If you research over and over until you find “the perfect tool”, or “the perfect platform” (hint: the rank is constantly changing), you’re stuck on the first step to anywhere. In fact, reading other people’s blogs, for example, are not enough to learn what is the best — you need to at least have some working knowledge to even decide which tool or platform is more suitable for you. Therefore, the most sensible thing to do is to do a little bit of research (combined with your gut feeling), pick up something that makes you feel good at the moment, and immediately get rolling. Well, of course you need some research, otherwise you’re just kidding yourself; doing <code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import this</code> in python tells you:</p>

<blockquote><p>Now is better than never.<br>
Although never is often better than <em>right</em> now.</p></blockquote>

<p>Then, when you have more experience and know what’s wrong with your original choice, correct it or trash it. There’s nothing wrong with abandoning dated crap, hopping bandwagons, or whatever; that’s the nature of change and improvement, and the most sensible thing for someone as busy as you are.</p>

<p>Up till now I&rsquo;ve been talking about tools and platforms, so maybe it seems that I&rsquo;m attacking the straw man — you may argue that the original quote is not about what tools or platforms you use, but rather, what you try to accomplish with the tools or platforms. Okay, what about the grander things in life, like mathematical research, like <em>the final theory</em>? Well, similar. I’ll quote Ravi here,</p>

<blockquote><p>…mathematics is so rich and infinite that it is impossible to learn it systematically, and if you wait to master one topic before moving on to the next, you’ll never get anywhere. Instead, you’ll have tendrils of knowledge extending far from your comfort zone. Then you can later backfill from these tendrils, and extend your comfort zone; this is much easier to do than learning “forwards”.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ravi is always hinting at “you should get started with actual research rather than ‘prepare’ yourself”! I can’t reckon that since I’ve yet to follow Ravi’s advice, but the thinking here is crystal clear. <strong>You shouldn’t be afraid of failure; you shouldn’t be afraid of being “not prepared enough”; you shouldn’t be afraid of getting started.</strong> Speaking of a final theory, I’m pretty sure I’m bound to fail, I’m pretty sure I won’t see a satisfactory one in my lifetime — the inconvenient truth is that, I have the gut feeling that the ultimate explanation is unfortunately intertwined with consciousness, and we are still far from having the right tools to understand consciousness. According to Feynman, <strong>really knowing something is hard</strong>. It’s hard, so failure is not shameful at all. Those who won’t even get started due to fear of failing or making the wrong choice won’t fail again, since they’ve already failed at the very beginning. So, get rolling.</p>

<p>Yesterday I read <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000339.html">Fire and Motion</a> on <em>Joel on Software</em>. Joel’s metaphor is really nice, but he’s essentially conveying very similar ideas.</p>

<p>By the way, I wrote this post in Emacs. I don’t know why but I seem to type much faster in Emacs than in Mou. (For Markdown editing <code>markdown-mode</code>, and <code>typo-mode</code>, a minor mode I found today which is useful for inserting smart quotes and smart dashes seamlessly into md articles).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Quick call for <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/mou-1-0-markdown-editor-on-os-x-for-you">Mou 1.0 fundraiser</a> on Indiegogo. At the time of writing, it has raised $6,178/$20,000, and has 39 days to go (with 21 already passed).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m actually writing this post in Mou right now. It&rsquo;s far less powerful than Emacs, but when I want preview-on-the-fly, Mou is the Markdown editor to go. Right now it&rsquo;s far from perfect; for instance, GFM fenced blocks (now included in <a href="http://commonmark.org">CommonMark</a>) are not supported, so you get nonsense preview when your code block is fenced rather than indented. (Of course, Mou is even less suitable for editing an Octopress post due to the yaml metadata upfront, but that&rsquo;s not a big deal.)</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s hope for Mou hitting the 1.0 mark.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post marks my transition from Tumblr to Octopress &amp; GitHub Pages.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been microblogging for a while at <a href="http://zshello3.tumblr.com">zshello3.tumblr.com</a> and I liked it. Not because of readers, which I suspect I have none; but there are certainly a huge amount of information I want to dump off my mind. Back in the days I <em>loved</em> my handwritten journals, and I really poured a lot into them. Peers were usually amazed when they saw my journals. These days typing seems to be a more robust solution to keeping my thoughts, especially when the thoughts are mostly technical.</p>

<p>Tumblr is awesome. Compared to WordPress (.com for pedantic people), it is both lightweight and beautiful (you get all the customization for free), so you quickly get to the writing. However, it is not designed for geeks, so</p>

<ul>
<li>Customization is capped at some point;</li>
<li>I had the impression that the Markdown parser is herrendous;</li>
<li>Email publishing is a mightmare, by the way;</li>
<li>Code rendering always falls short — unless I spend a lot of time customizing (I&rsquo;m pretty bad at HTML, CSS, and JS stuff).</li>
</ul>


<p>Speaking of the last point, I&rsquo;ve always been envious of the beautiful code blocks found on Octopress blogs. So here I come!</p>

<p>(Let me give it a try first.)</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>hello.c</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='C'><span class='line'><span class="cp">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">argc</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">**</span><span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Hello, Octopress!</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Gorgeous. I&rsquo;ll get to the theme customization later. I&rsquo;m actually busy as crazy this week.</p>
